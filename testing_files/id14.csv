ER follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.

The patient states he was not staying on top of his blood sugar readings and felt "" woozy "" over the weekend. His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.

Regarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.

Regarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out.

He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.

Right index finger pain.

HPI:

Ms. James is a 42-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right index finger pain. She states she injured it while skiing. She states she fell and jammed her finger. She took Ibuprofen on but it did not help her. She denies any icing it or wearing a splint. She rates her pain 7/10.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

EXAM

Examination of the right hand reveals pain to palpation of the MCP and DIP joints.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right index finger show no obvious signs of fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right index finger DIP joint sprain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a splint. A prescription is provided for Mobic 15 mg once a day, dispense 14. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks for a repeat evaluation. If she is unimproved, we will consider hand therapy at that time. All questions were answered.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right index finger pain following skiing fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. James is a 42-year-old female who presents today with a five-day history of right-index finger pain following a skiing fall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Ms. James is a 42-year-old female who appears well-nourished, alert and pleasant. She makes good eye contact, remains well-oriented and in no acute distress.

VITALS REVIEWED: BP 130/82, HR 70, R 16 and afebrile.

RESULTS: X-rays were reviewed in the room with the patient after reviewing the patient's symptoms without previous pain in her neck, arm or shoulder to warrant imaging those areas, and the index finger was not swelling nor deformed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. James is a 42-year-old woman with a chief complaint of right-index finger pain following a skiing fall. X-rays demonstrated a normal right hand, and physical examination is significant for a normal examination of the wrist and x-rays shows right index finger distal interphalangeal joint where she is unable to flex/extend easily. IMPRESSION: Sprain of distal interphalangeal joint, right finger.

PLAN: Ms. James will be splinted in the office with a stack splint. She will be prescribed meloxicam 15mg once daily with 14 tablets and a prophylactic antibiotic if it's swollen or she cannot clean the area regularly. She is to avoid heavy lifting or repetitive motions of that hand. Hopefully she has a good result with these instructions, and we will plan to follow her finger position in two weeks."

She has a surgical history significant for prior left upper extremity surgery.

EXAM

Examination of the left shoulder shows pain with range of motion.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder, 3 views obtained on today's visit show no obvious signs of fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.
","Subjective: 
A 44-year-old female presents with left shoulder pain for one week. Patient took Tylenol for pain for two to three days without relief. Patient is a right-handed gymnast who suffered an injury to the left shoulder during a gymnastics class. Patient sustains pain when moving the shoulder in any direction.

2. Prescribed analgesic in-office defined as Ibuprofen 600 milligrams three times a day with food for one week.
3. Prescribed education about limiting weight-lifting/ heavy activity with left arm. Patients advised regularly scheduled three to four weekly follow-up time with the primary care provider, for reassessment of the left shoulder pain, is important to try again' at the speed limit. Today's office visit entailed the use of x-ray follow-up utilization of a steroid injection at the site of the left shoulder pain. Consideration for referral for further outpatient evaluation if the pain intensifies and currently experiences intrusive or more than two characteristic pain events daily. May I help you with primary care clinic follow-up at the point of care today/ in the early morning/ late afternoon.

During the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.

The patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.

[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Randy Gutierrez is a 9-month-old male who is being evaluated today for a cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. He is accompanied by his mother.

Symptoms began yesterday around dinnertime with clear nasal drainage, pulling on his ears bilaterally, and rubbing his nose frequently. He does not have a barky cough or a sore throat. His rectal temperature was 100.3 degrees. The patient did consume a 7 ounce bottle this morning, but mostly denied the next offered bottle and declined cereal. He is irritable and having trouble falling asleep, described “like he is fighting it”.

The patient has been exposed to an older sister who is sick and a cousin who has a sinus infection.

Treatment has included saline nasal spray, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier. When the patient aroused this morning, he was warm to the touch. When his sleeper was removed, he was quite sweaty despite the air conditioner being on.

The patient's dandruff is also worsening. The only tried treatment is Aveeno shampoo.

Viral infection
The patient presents with a viral infection and does not need antibiotics currently. I advised continuation of fluids, rest. Additionally, I suggested trying Zarbee’s for children under 1 years old. If a croup cough develops, the patient will receive a 0.5 teaspoon.

I also provided counseling to the mother to avoid giving honey to the patient for his first year of life due to botulism spores.

Dandruff
The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of dandruff. I recommended Head and Shoulders shampoo, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D 2 times per week, combined with his usual shampoo. I counseled the mother that she should be careful not to get the shampoo in the patient eyes and to not use the extra strength shampoos. Additionally, he may also use baby oil and a soft brush on the area.

[doctor] when you say , "" wipe your face in the morning , "" do you use a product or just water ?
[patient] mm , just water and a washcloth , really . if i feel really greasy , sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning , too .
[doctor] okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ?
[patient] mm , i would say it's probably a good day for me , of course , since i'm here , right ?
[doctor] acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] and do you get a regular period ?
[patient] yup .
[doctor] how long have you been getting a regular period ?
[patient] mm , i think about two years .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] the biggest flare , probably , was when she started school sports in the fall , just with all the sweating .
[doctor] yup , that will do it . is there anything else that you've noticed , mrs. ward ?
[patient_guest] no . kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen . it just does n't seem to help as much as we wanted .
[doctor] got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component .
[patient] okay , so is there anything we can do to help it ?
[doctor] yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , "" noncomedogenic , "" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so .

New acne evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today.

Kayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient’s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.

The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Lives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.

FAMILY HISTORY

No significant family medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Comedonal acne.
• Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

PLAN

Comedonal acne.
We discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.

Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.
Reassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow recommended cleaning regimen.
Start Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.
Follow up in 6 months.

 "
13,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .

ASSESSMENT

• Macromastia.

Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.

PLAN

An extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.

Risks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

The patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.

[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?

[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .

[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .

Mrs. Wood presents today for renal ultrasound. The patient has had recurrent episodes of hematuria over the past few months secondary to chronic urolithiasis. Mrs. Wood reports passing two small stone like structures last week. Urinalysis today was notable for only a trace amount of blood and the renal ultrasound revealed a 6 mm non-obstructing renal stone in the left kidney.

PLAN

No surgical intervention is recommended, and the patient would like to discuss urolithiasis prevention. We had a very lengthy discussion with regards to urolithiasis formation and treating the underlying cause to prevent reoccurrence and associated potential dietary factors that could be involved with urolithiasis formation.

It is recommended that the patient maintain a healthy diet; limit salt, and animal protein. she should increase fluid consumption; adequate intake is half of her body weight in ounces of water daily and avoid sugary drinks. A copy of the dietary recommendations and avoidances was provided to the patient for reference. We will continue to monitor annually with renal ultrasound unless new symptoms develop. The patient voiced understanding and agreed with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 1 year with renal ultrasound, sooner should symptoms arise. Should you develop sudden onset of severe pain or gross hematuria go to the emergency room.

[doctor] ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .
[patient] yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .
[doctor] i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?

[doctor] okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?
[patient] no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .
[doctor] okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?
[patient] uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .
[doctor] what is a while ?
[patient] it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .
[doctor] okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?
[patient] yeah , just often enough for me to notice .
[doctor] understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?
[patient] uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .
[doctor] okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?
[patient] yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .
[doctor] are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
[patient] that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
[doctor] yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .
[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .

[patient] good .
[doctor] yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
[patient] yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
[doctor] great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .

[patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .

[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .
[doctor] for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today .
[doctor] her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only .
[doctor] her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated .
[doctor] and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Heart murmur.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.

Ms. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a “new, worrisome” heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling “overly tired” but attributes this to her polypharmacy.

The patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.

Musculoskeletal
Lower extremity edema

Neurologic
Gait normal for age.

RESULTS

EKG
Impression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.

ASSESSMENT

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Patient Diana Scott is 100 years old, is coming in to establish care with me, with a chief complaint of ""heart murmur.""

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 100-year-old Caucasian female, who comes in today to establish care with me. Today, we plan to complete a full review of systems and a physical examination.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Constitutional: assess the patient's activity level and energy, last 6-12 months. Weight changes present or unexplained.

Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, GERD, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, abdominal cramps, etc. Hepatitis, cholecystitis, Cholelithiasis, Pancreatitis, appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or diverticulitis. Use a pain scale when indicated.
Genitourinary: Changes to urination, dysuria, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, polyuria, nocturia, oliguria, hematuria, incontinence, and straining. Frequency, urgency, urgency incontinence, stress incontinence, diverticula, hematoma, scar tissue?, stones, infections, continence. MVA, renal or genitourinary trauma to spine/pelvic area.
Skin: Changes in skin color, itching, rashes, hives, warts, psoriasis, scabies, lice, herpes, shingles, impetigo, skin breakdown.
Musculoskeletal: Pain related to muscular/skeletal system, joints, stiffness, arthritis, back pain, neck pain
Neurologic: a change in headache frequency or severity, seizures, sensory, motor or coordination changes (incoordination, balance, clumsiness).
Psychiatric: changed in mood (Irritability, argumentativeness), change in sleep pattern (early AM awakenings, hypersomnia, insomnia), change in cognition/memory (Concentration, word-finding), change in suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, psychotic behaviors.
Endocrine
Heme/Immuno: A reduced immunity and ability to combat infections, recurrent infections, known wounds on the skin.
Allergic/Immunologic: this patient has penicillin allergies, asthma, or other.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood Pressure: 160/74 Pulse: 64 Respiratory Rate 12.

VITALS REVIEWED: Initial vital signs reviewed from the nurse as follows: BP: 160/74, Pulse: 64, Respirations: 12, Temp: 36.7, and Oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

RESULTS: Your labs and EKG were reviewed at this time. Your labs showed a microcytic hypochromic anemia. Iron studies were consistent with chronic disease. Her liver function tests showed an AST of 30 and an ALT of 33. A TSH was low at 0.03. Therefore, the patient is started on 25 micrograms of levothyroxine. A DEXA scan done on 1/18 was normal. Most recent cholesterol level is a total cholesterol of 150, an HDL of 37, and a triglyceride of 194 on 1/10/10. The hemoglobin-Alc is 6.6%. Her TEE showed stress-induced ischemia in the LAD artery with coronary artery spasm; she was evaluated by ICA, which showed good peripheral flow. Sarcoidosis has not been proven but remains on the differential diagnosis.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 100-year-old Caucasian female patient who established care with me. We will do a full exam and complete a full history, physical and review of systems to better understand her multiple medical co-morbidities.
INSTRUCTIONS: Refer the patient to an ophthalmologist and get an ultrasound of her right leg as soon as possible.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: BABY ASPIRIN, acetaminophen, loratadine, and meclizine. She was given magnesium oxide to try for her constipation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has a history of coronary artery disease, decreased kidney function, hyperthyroidism, strokes, hypertension, and a heart attack. She has non-insulin-requiring diabetes.

EXAM: Blood pressure is up this number would be today. Her heart rate shows an oddity: she shows multiple premature ventricular contractions. We will get an echocardiogram as soon as possible. Her examination is completed at this time after a full review of her multiple medical history. She showed all signs otherwise normal of the Caucasian elderly who is not acutely ill.
IMPRESSION: 1. High blood pressure 2. PVCs
PLAN: Please follow up with me in about four weeks so we can decide what further steps we need to take in light of your echocardiogram. If I ever again use an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker, also help Yolanda. She is one of our best for pain management but also try hot packs on bedsore itself."

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Charles Sullivan is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness of breath. The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.

He enjoys hunting.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.
HEAD: No angioedema.
RESPIRATORY: No audible stridor. I do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields.
SKIN: No rash.

RESULTS

A chest x-ray, obtained and reviewed today is normal.
Pulmonary function test, obtained and reviewed today is normal.

ASSESSMENT

Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity

[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury

Low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Brooks is a pleasant 39-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. He is accompanied today by his partner.

Approximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.

RESULTS

X-rays obtained and reviewed in office today were normal.

ASSESSMENT

Low back sprain.

PLAN

The examination findings and x-ray results were discussed with the patient and his partner today. I recommend we treat this conservatively with rest, meloxicam, and formal physical therapy. If he fails to improve, we can consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Low back pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a ___-year-old male who was in his yard raking leaves and felt fine; however, when he got into the house, his back started tightening up, and he developed pins and needles in his right foot. He has mild pain on flexion with palpation to his lower lumbar spine, somewhat to the left of the L5 area. He denied radiation of the pain of the extremities. He said he felt a mild tingling on his right foot. He said never had any surgery in the past and no injury or trauma. It appears he followed his pain for 6 hours without taking any medication. He was not taking any chronic pain medications. He smokes? nonsmoker. He drinks alcohol? Non drinker. He is sexually active; however, no significant shoulder pain. He denies any radiculopathy to the lower extremities. He said the only flexion position is when he bends over, noticing a lot of cramping in the paraspinal muscles. On exam, he was able to sit and lay very well; however, extension was difficult standing his pain up was a 3/10 and increased to a 6/10 with ambulation, decreased to 0/10 when returning to a seated position he said a time or two. He was not taking any medication; however, discontinued. He denies any history of dizziness, falls, or syncopal episodes. He denies any current weakness; he reports more difficulty bringing up his feet when trying to walk. Denies any hemeatochezia or melena. His exam was well tolerated. A positive straight leg raise was found bilaterally up to 30 degrees.
All other systems reviewed are negative. He had no history of allergy. The patient doesn't have any history of family members with the same problem; however, family was home with him at the time. History of getting up and sitting down and laying down significant back pain within minutes, appearance of severe low back spasms within past few days. Patient was concerned at the time of the examination about the back pain and the leg pain. 

VITALS REVIEWED:
heard and understood

RESULTS: L5-S1 normal x-ray

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is mostly due to lumbar back strain and radiculopathy of the right foot. We elected to try an NSAID of Meloxicam starting at 15 mg daily and giving the patient some exercise precautions in the way of sitting, standing, and walking. He ran to the bathroom, was standing up, all of a sudden slipped on a rock, and immediately revealed his pain. He continually walks with a cane to slightly offload his pain. He continually has cramping in his lower back. He is also given some muscle relaxants at bedtime, should he develop pain from this. This is going to be an MRI in 2 weeks follow up with recommendations as necessary. He is given an MRI at 2-week following when the pain started, should he develop increasing leg pain. If he remains unchanged, to continue with his current medication and continue on his NSAID. If his pain is not improved, than x-ray findings of his back as a followup visit. He was done with current back pain. He also needs to do daily hot and warm compresses as well as NSAID medications, should he develop back pain from this. He is given a letter of 2 weeks, should he continue with increasing pain and improving pain, he will be able to see improvements, he should consider therapy for this.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
He should do heat pads at bedtime before going to bed. He is to be placed in a bath of medium hot water using a washcloth, and considerable improvements should be seen within a week. He should take 1 pill p.o. daily as needed by his back. He is to avoid hormone replacement therapy as this was determined to be the cause of his hemeatochezia issue.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
Meloxicam 15 mg every night with improved pain control.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
The patient had never had any problem with his back before today.

EXAM: 
Mr. Smith is a nurse and followed up on a good, satisfactory exam.

IMPRESSION:
Linked back strains, his x-rays were normal.

PLAN:
Meloxicam 15 mg daily in the morning or as needed. Back pain from back strain or radicuhte.

ASSESSMENT: 
Mr. Brianne has shown excellent improvements in his back pain. I suggested getting an MRI of his back and legs at this time to determine where for us on an MRI should be performed on him or his partner."
20,"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it
[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly
[doctor] do n't recall alright
[patient] something i had taken it before
[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Hernandez is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. Onset of ulcer was approximately 2 months ago after walking barefoot on the beach. He reports the ulcer has recently become red and is draining. At times he will also experience throbbing pain. He has seen his primary care physician and was prescribed antibiotics, however, he has not started them yet and does not recall the name of the medication.

The patient is a diabetic. He is taking medication for this, however, he does not monitor his blood sugar consistently. His last A1C was around 10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with redness and drainage.

VITALS

Vital signs are normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect laterally just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some redness and drainage present as well as edema. No necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. Nontender to palpation.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot. Debridement will be performed. A prescription for clindamycin 400 mg 2 times per day for 7 days will be provided as he does seem to have an infection. He will also be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support for the next month.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and for possible repeat debridement. He has been advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and we will get him in sooner, however, if he starts to develop a fever or necrosis he has been instructed to go to the ER.
","Chief Complaint: Nonhealing foot ulcer

History of Present Illness:

Gregory, a male in his 50's, presents today with a chronic, nonhealing foot ulcer. The patient reports that he first noticed the ulcer approximately two months ago. He denied having any known trauma to his foot and reports that it developed seemingly spontaneously. The patient reported that he was walking barefoot on the beach, specifically at Dewey Beach, when the index ulcer formed. The patient reports that the site has not been painful, but he has noted intermittently bothersome throbbing pain. Apart from the discoloration, Mr. Gregory reported that at present, there is redness associated with the wound site and an unknown volume of drainage has been observed. 

The patient relates that he has been diagnosed with diabetes, however, the patient has remained vague on the subject of how well this chronic condition is managed. He reiterated that he takes his prescribed insulin requirements as directed by his PCP. Mr. Gregory states that he was prescribed an antibiotic by his PCP for the redness and discoloration and but could not remember the specifics of the medication prescribed. Upon follow-up on today's visit, he has confirmed that he had not yet picked up the prescription from the pharmacy.

Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.

The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.

Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Skin: Reports right foot wound.
Neurological: Reports neuropathy.

VITALS

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.
SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp
[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.

His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.

24,"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today
[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[patient] no it's right here
[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
[patient] okay that's it that's all i got
[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan
[patient] sure sounds good
[doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.

26,"[doctor] alright
[patient] good morning Julie how are you doing today
[doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches
[patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here
[doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe
[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on
[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation
[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse
[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the
[doctor] in my on the side of my vision
[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face
[doctor] no i have n't
[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running
[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics
[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[doctor] it is
[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Julie Jenkins is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of headaches. The patient was referred from her primary care physician. The patient states that she was seen by Dr. White a few years ago and was going to obtain an MRI; however, Dr. White wanted her to see me first and urgently.

The onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager. Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.

The patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct
[patient] that's correct yes
[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct
[patient] yes that's right
[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[patient] kills
[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit
[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[doctor] yeah yeah well
[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore
[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

Right elbow pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):
Mark Jackson is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes Type 2 and mild intermittent asthma. He reports right elbow pain, which has worsened over the past three weeks. The pain is mostly located on the outside part of his elbow and is worse with movement, sharp, and stabbing, radiating nowhere. The intensity of his is eight out of ten with movements and three out of ten at rest. The patient denies any recent trauma to the elbow. He has tried Tylenol and ibuprofen for the pain, without significant relief, and has also tried ice without any benefit. The only recent change in activity for Mark has been an increased amount of tennis-playing.
CONNECTION TO SAFETY/ILLNESS: Tennis has been a safe activity for the patient until recently, as he has noted that he has turned up the dial to play a lot more in the past couple weeks. The only significant uncontrolled pain impacting his activity is playing tennis. We should defer to his final comment about not being young anymore, and his apt observation that the acronym for his diagnosis (tennis elbow) makes him feel like a loser. We should follow through with the prescribed activity changes and intravenous appliance to the right elbow for four to six weeks.

HIS PAST HISTORY:
The patient has a history of diabets Type 2 and mild intermittent asthma.  Additionally the patient has a history of a cholecystectomy ten years prior.

ALLERGIES:
Penecillin

Albuterol, Flovent and Metformin

MEDICATIONS:
Ultrim 50 mg every one day./mg twice a day.
Metformin 500 mg twice a day.

RESULTS:
No acute fracture or other boney abnormality of right elbow X-ray done today.

EXAM OF RIGHT ELBOW:
Normal exam findings. Pain at rest eight on scale of 10, three on scale of ten when playing tennis. No swelling, erythema, or ecchymosis. Passive and active range of motion were preserved with pain at the extremes of motion. Radial pulse intact cap refill of hand less than two seconds. Right wrist and fingers are neurovascularly intact as well. The patient remains in no distress. His exam today is very similar to the previous visit. 

IMPRESSION:
1. Most consistent with tennis elbow.
2. Marked lateral epicondylar tenderness of right elbow.
3. NO Acute fracture or other boney abnormality on right elbow x-ray today.

PLAN:
1. Rest right arm effectively taking a break from tennis for a month.
2. Re evaluate.
3. Ultram for take-home prescription for elbow pain as needed.
4. Prescription for RT Elbow and forearm brace for wearing resuming occasional tennis activity.
5. Follow-up with me in four to five weeks for re evaluation.

31,"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms
[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs
[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
[patient] yeah for the most part
[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er
[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then
[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those
[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation
[patient] probably about a month ago
[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center
[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again
[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis
[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana
[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all
[patient] hmmm hmmm
[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that
[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i do n't try to go there often
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam
[patient] okay
[doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.
- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.

[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection

[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked
[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
[patient] i had my tonsils out
[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press

[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan

She has had no episodes of instability. She does not note hurting her knee in the past. When asked about possible MRI or surgery and decided to go ahead and operate. She has been told that torn meniscus does not always hurt as much as the pain that the patient describes. She says that she will go ahead and have the MRI and is thinking about her right knee more now. She has been icing as well and that seems to help as does taking naproxen. At this point, she would like to go ahead and have surgery as the pain is enough to affect her quality of life. This has affected her work as she has been unable to work for the last three days. She is going to try one more time to reach workers comp tomorrow. She would like pain relief and she had a total unrelated procedure to see if it might help.

INSTRUCTIONS
The doctor suggests that the patient call tomorrow and obtain permission to have a WC case manager to have the MRI and then to have a meeting with the reurn of WC case manager. The patient says that he plans to go ahead and schedule surgery with Dr. X then as he is very hopeful that this is what will heal her problem that she has been unable to get any help with so far. The doctor suggests that the person ask the WP to call her tomorrow to make sure that she can have an MRI ordered as already scheduled. He also suggests talking with WC to see if the daily employee I can call her as early as tomorrow if she is not comfortable. You may want to consider repeating the MRI every six to eight weeks and if the physical therapist feels that her condition can be improved. The right knee was examined thoroughly and everything was checked out. X ref. has been ordered by Dr. plans to schedule surgery in the near future with Dr. He looks forward to being able to plan a surgery as he has been injured now for nearly two weeks. The patient says that she has no concerns about her blood pressure and that the doctor does not have any concerns about it. She did have her blood pressure checked today with the right finger being able to be placed. The nurse phoned the right knee X ref.for the MRI and the patient is now hopeful to schedule surgery with OX in the near future. The doctor has further instructed the patient to do some further as we have a result that will just maybe only be a bit more in support of the plans to be inated or possibly uprighted which would be great. The patient has seen her doctor and he is hopeful that that is the right course of action and he is hopeful that that will work. He has some limited humor as he says it will not hurt but there still have been no results for our testing which is right for his particular issues. He says that he is doing everything that we ask him to do. On the surgical front, she has no concerns and is hopeful that the surgery she is finally being given the right place will help her. This surgery she says brings him to hope that he may return to work and that he will have some answers finally. He says that he is hopeful of anything that the doctor suggests will help him as he says that he is in despair which is why he is considering a change in treatment because he is so hopeless. The doctor says that some relief will be forthcoming from the surgery but that he wants to give it time as he says that he will let me know as I am their enemy as a patient. If you have any further questions about this procedure, please do not hesitate to contact the physician or the physical therapist you have been seeing, as he or she will be able to answer any questions that you might have."

Cough.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of rheumatoid arthritis. He denies any previous history of lung infections or pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he stopped smoking tobacco 7 years ago and has felt better since doing so. He notes that he enjoys biking.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his mother has a history of breast cancer, but is doing well. He denies any family history of lung cancer.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking methotrexate 7.5 mg every week.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 70 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.

Integumentary
- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.

RESULTS

CT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right upper lobe lung nodule.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male presenting with an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule on a prior CT scan. He was asymptomatic but also noted a persistent mild cough that's been ongoing for approximately three months. It has generally improved over the last two weeks and has not recurred since. Additionally, he has a long history of rheumatoid arthritis which has been well controlled on medical therapy not associated with pulmonary symptoms. He is not short of breath but has had no recent weight loss or hemoptysis. He is a previous smoker. 
Patient is very anxious about recent findings PFH: Rheumatoid arthritis smoking status is seven and a half. He has never had this type of study done before. As he noted, he's always been healthy. He has never had any other surgery.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco use currently - Denies alcohol or drug use - Truck driver - Wife and two sons- Noncontributory - Reports bicycle riding and dental work 
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had surgery in 2002 for breast cancer. No other pertinent family history. 
SURGICAL HISTORY: Rheumatoid arthritis - No previous surgeries
PAST HISTORY: Rheumatoid arthritis - Adults - Rheumatoid arthritis and joint deformities - Penicillin (rheumatic?) started on hydroxychloroquine - On hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate
ALLERGIES: He had penicillin many years ago. This was work related skin rash.
EXAM: Blood pressure - Heart rate - Respiration rate - O2 sat 98% on room air - Denies any fever. PE: well developed, well-nourished, cooperative, in no acutely distress. Cardiovascular: No murmurs - Lungs clear. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Patient with incidentally found lung nodule based upon CAT scan. The nodule is well circumscribed, small, and smooth walled. I think that it may well be as benign as it appears on the CT exam HOWEVER because of previous cigarette smoking and current RA I feel that it should be removed. To that end, I've ordered a PET exam in order to further evaluate the nodule in view that it is small we should be able to remove this more or less as an outpatient procedure. However, a pulmonary function study should be obtained to have on record pre-operatively. I have spoken with him about the recommendation that he follow up with his pulmonologist and rheumatologic and continue his regularly prescribed therapy with the observation that as long as feels well this is not urgently needed."

[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided facial pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.
HENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
Bilateral finger rub test is negative.
- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.

RESULTS

MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

ASSESSMENT

Neck sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommended an MRI for further evaluation. I have also prescribed the patient Robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat his pain. I have also advised him to utilize ice, a heating pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze on his neck as needed. I have also provided him with a home exercise program to work on his range of motion. I advised the patient that he will not be able to work until we have the MRI results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me after his MRI for results.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**
Neck pain.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
The patient reported that his neck pain started after a car accident that occurred in February, which had been an ongoing issue since then. He reported experiencing severe pain rated as 12/10. He also reported previous car crashes, and visits to therapists, and lawyers but reported that he had not taken any fentanyl prescribed to him by the pain clinic recently. The pain specialist also advised to seek medical consultation after car crashes.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
Given the history, the review of systems included head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, musculoskeletal, skin, cardiovascular and lungs.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
The patient's range of motion was assessed as limited in flexion and extension but within normal range side to side. He reported pain with palpation of the anterior and posterior neck and had no obvious deformity. No rash or swelling was noted and no ecchymosis on the back or neck was observed.

**VITALS REVIEWED:**
The patient's vital signs were reviewed and appeared within normal limits.

**RESULTS:**
The patient had an x-ray prior to coming where there was no bleed seen and MRI was advised.

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**
Neck sprain based on imaging results. We will manage conservatively. Looking at the MRI, we will decide on further management. We'll ask him to keep his neck immobile with a brace and conservative measures as above. The medication was given as noted based on what is known to help with muscle spasms caused by traumatic events.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
This was extensively covered in the dialogue but included his non-drug therapy protocol will be forthcoming, with some physical therapy, we will be giving a home exercise regimen this is really just gentle range of motion and strengthening exercises which are gonna be tailored to where his understandable limitations are currently active across multiple major muscle groups. fireEvent_EXTERN with the rehabilitation consult for about the second or the third visit based on how well he unions like the successful completion of his home program.

**MEDICATIONS:**
Muscle relaxant.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
Including history of previous car accidents not well explained, several stints in therapy for neck pain and muscle spasms, and the need seen by JC on date where patches prescribed is what time he dates and whether he was seen in SGH.

**EXAM:**
The patient was cooperative with the exam but had increasing levels of pain during the examination as described in the physical exam.

**IMPRESSION:**
This consult is placed on behalf of our colleague and the above are our patient's consultation.

**PLAN:**
Will be to see him back within the next several days to make sure that this conservative approach is helping him with his neck pain based on the physical exam and consultation by the colleagues but what we got this was the best approach to take."

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?

Follow-up of chronic problem.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Carolyn Garcia is a 49-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for follow-up of her chronic problem.

The patient reports her osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately, and she would like to talk about that, primarily in her elbows. She states she has been sitting at the computer more in the office, so she is unsure if it is stagnant in that position all day. She notes her right elbow bothers her more than her left elbow, but she is primarily typing all day versus writing. She denies any other joint pain. She notes occasional numbness and tingling in her hands, which she tries to shake out her arms to relieve the numbness.

She also has a history of gout. Her last episode was about 3 months ago. She had some inflammation of her toe at that time. She denies any other issues with that. She states the medication she was given at that time helped with her gout and she has not seen a flare up since. She reports her psoriasis is under control and has not been a major problem for her either. She is still on colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day as needed for flare-ups of her gout.

50,"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","Notes: Patient is a 20-year-old female undergoing her yearly check-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . Patient was switched from Symbicort to Wixela in April 2020 and she reports it is working well . She also uses Zyrtec for her seasonal allergy symptoms and admits she uses them on days she's outside a lot . She has a known peanut allergy but tolerates almonds and cashews . She also stated that she is in the process of applying to the military and is currently preparing for the entrance tests for the military and the doctor states the asthma is controlled most of the time but can be set off from strenuous activities like running . Patient also reports that she has cut back on vaping / smoking and that she used be a heavy smoker. Previous spirometry results look good , and patient and doctor discussed lowering usage to control asthma symptoms to counter attack sources of the asthma trigger.CONCLUSION: Controlled asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. REQUEST : Spirometry every 4 months. A request for act. Schedule spirometry for a follow-up appointment in 4 months."
51,"[doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3/2/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm fine , thank you .
[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?
[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT: 49-year-old male here for follow-up of hypertension
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Roberts is a 49-year-old male who comes in for an ambulatory follow-up of hypertension. He was in the emergency room with high blood pressure and palpitations. However, he thinks it was a panic attack. He's not felt it since then. He may have since developed resistant hypertension given his young age of developing high blood pressure, and despite being on three medications. The patient's blood pressure has shown an improvement, now he ranges in the 146-155 range. We will add spironolactone to control hyperaldosterone. The patient may need to go to the resistant hypertension clinic.
RESULTS: He had his potassium checked one week ago. It was 4.0 mmol/L.  His sodium level was 138.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

Constitutional:
Mr. Roberts is a well-developed, well-nourished male who appears his stated age
Lungs: They exhibit normal breath sounds throughout bilaterally. No evidence of rhonchi, wheezes, or crackles.
Cardiovascular: A regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Without error.
Extremities: No edema is seen. Capillary refill is less than two seconds.
NECK: Symmetry, trachea midline, and no JVD. There is no carotid bruit as-well.
Eyes: Bilateral conjunctiva anicteric,
 NEURO: Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Gait is normal.
VITALS: B/P 146/79 right upper extremity, 140/80 left upper extremity, Ph 77.  Heart rate = 85 a regular rhythm and having a good volume pulse.
IMPRESSION: Uncontrolled Resistant Hypertension
PLAN: We discussed spironolactone. Spironolactone is aldosterone antagonist that retains potassium and causes sodium to be excreted. In hypertension it is a perfectly good antihypertensive, providing there is no dysfunction in kidney function. We did discuss other adverse effects of spironolactone which includes breast swelling and breast tenderness. Another potential side effect of spironolactone is gynecomastia. Other side effects are dizziness and hyperkalemia. SPironolactone combined with thiazide diuretics can have effects on overall sodium and cause a hyponatremia. Again, sodium of 138 is fine but we will need to repeat electrolytes and a creatinine in two weeks. We discussed the resistant hypertension clinic oder if he is not doing well after being started on spironoalctone as well as chest pains.

We are going to see him in two weeks for monitoring of his potassium and sodium levels as well as his BP."

[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .
[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 3 months.","CLINICAL NOTE
DATE OF SERVICE: 11/02/20

CHIEF COMPLAINT (or CC):
86-year-old male with adult hydrocephalus

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):
Mr. Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus. The patient has been followed since May of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a Spino catheter protocol in June of 2020. He underwent shunt surgery on August 1st, 2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Significat for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss. 
Genitourinary: Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output. Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper.
Neurological: Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations. Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment.
Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals:
BP 124/80, HR 64, RR 18, weight 174 lbs, pain: 0/10
General: Pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily though his daughter does add some details. Shunt site was clean, dry, and intact with a confirmed setting of 2. 
Neurological: Cranial nerves, pupils are equal. EOMs are intact. Face is symmetric. Motor - normal for bulk and strength. Coordination - slow from finger-to-nose.

RESULTS:
Of note, the CT scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of Monro of 4.6cm with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated ""any extra-axial fluid collections."" There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

Diagnosis: Adult Hydrocephalus, gait impairment, urinary incontinence and urgency, and cognitive impairment.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
I just wanted to see you back just to talk mostly. I feel like things are going in the right direction.<meta>This means we don’t necessarily need to change the shunt even though I didn’t feel like you had any meningeal symptoms, and adjusting it in an asymptomatic situation has been show to possibly make things worse. This does not eliminate, however, the medical/legal considerations that could easily become the main consideration. So please look over the CT scan without making any changes for three more months and I will see you back at that time.<meta>If you do wish a change in the shunt, please let me know.
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
Should you develop any concerns or if there are any changes, please let me know as soon as possible.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
(Donepezil Hydrochloride 5 mg oral tablet, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg oral tablet, Topiramate 100 mg oral tablet)

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
We generally just have you on the memory regimen and diuretic therapy to help the bladder. The past surgical history is really limited to the shunt surgery and possibly a hernia repair which I'm sure was uneventful. 

ALLERGIES:
NKA

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Retired male who lives with daughter who helps him keep his appointments.

EXAM:
General: Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily, though his daughter does add some details. The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact with a confirmed setting of two. Neurological: Cranial nerves, pupils are equal. EOMs are intact. Face is symmetric. Motor normal for bulk and strength. Coordination slow from finger-to-nose.

IMPRESSION:
For the shunt, we'll go ahead and review this imaging and continue to watch for headaches or other meningeal signs. 

PLAN:
Keep the shunt the same for now. I will see you in three more months. I'm happy to see that you're doing so well and get updated from the family about how well you're doing.<meta>If there are any concerns or you have any problems, please don't hesitate to call my office or any member of my medical team.

[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .
[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .
[patient] you too .

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .

[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .

Assessment:
Mr. Nelson is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a well-established history of rheumatoid arthritis , returning for follow-up discussion on his right grossly effused knee with some pitting edema into the enveloping calf as well as he needs some overall management discussion. He had been on Xeljanz XR since January 2014 and Celebrex 200mg daily since October 2002. Both medications were helping, but now symptoms are worsening again. He was seen previously here 2 months ago. At that time and since 2014 recurrent episodes are when x-rays of his type knee showed joint space narrowing bilaterally, the patella are seated well in the trochlear groove the ACL and PCL remain unremarkable and bone density is increased, but the type 2 lateral view was overpenetrated. He thinks the Celebrex was helping and since discontinuation, no progress is noted. He has an unknown rheumatoid factor and ANA status but does get some morning stiffness which improves as the day goes by. His CMP levels are known to remain normal bilaterally. In addition his CBC and TSH remain known to be normal. His blood glucose is known predictably below the criteria by CDC Guideline for Diagnosis Predictors for Septis. The method is never in 41-4. The 33-5 months before his 12. Continuing bilateral knee pain and consultation is recommended_

PLAN:
Through the discussion , Mr. Nelson, I recommended he follow up with the local ER three weeks ago . The clinic informed him that the tr and viral testing was negative for allergies. He said he immediately started experiencing wheezing, severe fatigue , headache and then nausea and vomiting which has continued to today. He lives with family and does covid-19 Testing at his household . His RBC Reverse Czech was known to remain a near normal and his ferritin was unknown to be normal It is recommended that he and the pneumonia vaccine too. No further imaging at this time. X-ray in the ER were ncest hope thats materials th at did not show any changes to his leg. He is recommended for Consultation for Special Ed. His physical therapy is scheduled for next week for evaluation and establishment of pre-op home actions. His son has his verbal approval to make his daughter POA. The patient can follow up with me directly through calls."
57,"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","[Chief Complaint]

[patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you
[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months
[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well
[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off
[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise
[patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there

[doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms
[patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press
[doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i
[patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there
[doctor] okay
[patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath
[doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal pain

[doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone
[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Adams is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. The onset of his pain began 4 months ago, when he was moving boxes out of his son’s college dorm. At that time, he noted tingling in his right toes, which resolved after approximately 1 hour. After his injury, he felt as though he was unable to support his upper body weight. The patient reports weakness in his legs when carrying heavy objects. He reports a sharp pain in his lower back when he turns a certain way or rolls over in his sleep. The pain will resolve with repositioning. The patient was seen at urgent care and was referred to obtain an MRI, however he did not undergo this secondary to insurance issues. He has been utilizing Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, which does not provide relief. The patient notes the ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than the Tylenol, however it does not relieve his symptoms. He denies upset stomach with the use of ibuprofen.

62,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay
[patient] okay

[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else

[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Teresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief. The patient denies any previous elbow injuries.

The patient has a history of hypertension. She states she has been checking her blood pressures regularly. She adds that her blood pressures have been in the 110s to 130s range. She affirms she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and denies missing doses.

Regarding her diabetes type 2, she reports she sometimes forgets to take metformin 500 mg twice daily. At times, her blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. She states that she has a sweet tooth and indulges in home baked goods. For exercise, she walks in the evening and in the morning. She walks 1 to 2 miles per day around her neighborhood.

The patient enjoys working with ceramics as well as baking cakes and cinnamon rolls for family gatherings.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of hypertension and diabetes type 2.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 10 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 120/70 mmHg.
Pulse Rate: Appropriate.
Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 100% on room air.
Body Temperature: 97.9 degrees F.
Pain Level: 7/10 at its worst.

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. Pain with resisted pronation of the right forearm. Pain with flexion and bending the right wrist. No bruising or swelling. No discoloration or lesions.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right elbow was reviewed today. It demonstrated no evidence of any fractures. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.

I have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.

The patient’s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.

All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

65,"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
[patient] yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee lateral collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.

We will also check some knee x-rays to make sure there is no global loose bodies or significant chondral discontinuation at the knee joint undersurface, medial and lateral meniscus. Some have some check back at me in about two weeks for a progress evaluation."
66,"[doctor] hi dennis how are you today
[patient] good
[doctor] so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here
[patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf
[doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today
[patient] i i will run about ten klometers
[doctor] okay
[patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour
[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[doctor] okay
[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh

Dennis Martin is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right heel pain. The onset of his pain began 10 days ago while training for a triathlon. He locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his heel, which radiates proximally into his calf. His pain is aggravated by working out and when he first gets up in the morning. If he sits for a long period, his pain will return upon standing. The patient states that he runs 10 kilometers in the morning. At lunchtime, he tries to get on a bike for about 45 minutes to an hour. In the evening, he goes to the aquatic center and swims for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient states that he runs 5 days per week. He adds that he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride on weekends. He currently takes one day off from his exercises. The patient states that he does not stretch at all. He denies any left leg pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right heel pain. Denies left leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.

RESULTS

ASSESSMENT

Right Achilles tendinitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: ""Pain in the back of his right heel after long workout sessions or long periods of walking or standing.""

[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes

Non-healing right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christina Cooper is a pleasant 77-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. The onset of her wound began 1 year ago with no specific injury. The patient states that it seemed like a blister and she picked at it where it then turned red. The patient was seen by her primary care physician and was prescribed Keflex. She states that the antibiotics improved her symptoms, however they did not resolve them. The patient adds that she was last on Keflex 5 months ago. She denies any pain, however she reports decreased sensation in her foot. The patient also reports increased drainage and fatigue. She states that she has been wearing her regular shoes.

The patient has type 2 diabetes with neuropathy. She states that her blood sugars are running better than they were; however, they are still in the 200's. Her last hemoglobin A1C was 10.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer and drainage.

VITALS

No fever noted. Vitals look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. I do see some yellow slough that is present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. There is no evidence of fluid collection. I do not see necrosis. No odor. I do not appreciate any bony exposure. No pain to palpation.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right foot today reveals no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine her blood supply to see if we can heal the wound. We discussed doing a debridement in office today, which she agreed to. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support. I have also prescribed the patient collagenase ointment to apply to her wound 1 time per day and cover it with a sterile dressing. I advised the patient that this should be continued until we see the ulcer decrease in size.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress.","Chief Complaint:  A nonhealing foot ulcer of one year duration in a patient with diabetes.

On your right foot exam you have a one by two centimeter circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot.  The wound is proximal to the fifth MT joint. I see some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue, and you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis.  There isn't any evidence of fluid collection and she denies any streaking.  There is no evidence of necrosis.  There is no evidence of any malodor to the foot wound and on the examination, there is no bony exposure.  She denies any pain with palpation of her wound.  
  
Assessment and Plan
Impression is of a type 2 diabetic and well-controlled blood sugars with a HbA1c of 10.  Christina could benefit from intervention to this ongoing chronic wound and neuropathy.  My plan is to order a Ankle Brachial Index to access blood flow and determine if there is appropriate blood to be able to heal the wound.  I will also do a debridement of the wound of which patient was familiar, and I will prescribe collagenase ointment which can be used to the wound once a day and cover it with a sterile lifting and doing continued use of that until the could see the wound starting to shrink.  The patient has been advised that she should be wearing a surgical shoe to minimize extra pressure on the foot.  And we will see her back in two weeks for another evaluation.  NADA metabolic panel was obtained which showed good blood glucoses and electrolytes.  I will also see her back in two weeks for another evaluation.  Otherwise, I did discuss our plan with the patient.  
Instructions:  Reframes for sugar control and use of sugars to help heal a wound.  
Current Medications:  
Past Medical History:  Type II diabetes

68,"[doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing
[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent
[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time
[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time
[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath
[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine
[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me
[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles
[doctor] awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited
[patient] yeah yeah i'm excited
[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday
[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah
[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you

VITALS

Within normal limits

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.
- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.

The patient is here for follow-up after an inferior STEMI and interior stent placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

This 63-year-old Caucasian female has a history of RCA stents placed on 5/26/18. She presented on the 6th of this month with worsening chest pain. An EKG was consistent with inferior STEMI and aortography found 100% occlusion of mid-RCA as well as 100% ostial LCX lesion, intervened upon with RCA stent and a drug-eluting stent to the ostial LCX. She did well and on postoperative day 3 presented with chest pain L>R and woke up with new left arm weakness. This was concerning for re-infarction and she was brought to the cath lab where she was found to have a non-occlusive RCA dissection and a 90% ostial LCX stent thrombosis which was re-canalized without a new intervention. She is here tolerating her medication at the moment.

VITALS:

Blood pressure is stable at 110/70, heart rate is 70 and stable, EKG was previously done and showed a normal sinus rhythm and a good R wave progression.

SOCIAL HISTORY:

During the visit, the patient stated she is married and works as a spray painter. She doesn't drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. She has a 39-year history of smoking but claims she quit when she was 41. She denies a family history of strokes or heart attacks but has a history of alcoholism on her mother's side.

SURGICAL HISTORY:

She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy, gallbladder surgery, admitted for D&C, right iliofemoral endarterectomy, umbilical hernia repair, rectal dysplasia surgery, colonoscopy and removal of benign adrenal lesion.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

Positive for chest pain, weakness and headache. The patient denied having shortness of breath, abdominal pain or any other discomfort.

MEDICATIONS:

She stated she is taking ibuprofen p.r.n. and nitro p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:

The patient denies having any allergies to medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

The heart is normal with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. The patient has normal lung sounds. The patient has a diabetic foot ulcer. The patient's extremities exam with 1+ pitting edema to the thighs. The wound has been weeping yellowish discharge. The pulse is normal throughout but capillary refill is documented to be two seconds. No tenderness or tissue changes, but some mild swelling was noted on the right leg. There are no sores or insulin being required daily. The patient is well-appearing but does have a slight allergic reaction at the cath site on the same side during physical exam. The patient says she will follow up. The wound measures 5 ½ cm x 5 cm. The patient was sutured. 

IMPRESSION:

1. Diagnosis is adrenal insufficiency.
2. Patient is in need of heparin therapy.

PLAN:

A chest X-Ray and a thyroid test are being done. Upcoming appointments are for echocardiogram and holter monitor. The patient's important records will be sent to Chase Credit Card (CCC).

INSTRUCTIONS:

We asked the patient to keep her follow-up appointment with her primary care provider. The patient is advised to go for an echocardiogram and she heard about phone calls for that and is ready for this. The patient promised to follow all instructions even though there is a bunion on the left foot as well as some edema. The patient is reluctant to collect the prescription but promised to go for her blood work. She will have some labs done today, I called the labs for you and she said she would go and I scheduled this appt. without having her come up. Her discharge instructions will also be offered, travel preparation and retrieved from Chase Credit Card as needed. If there are any issues, contact our pharmacy for assistance. The therapy will start as soon as her discharge time. If the labs come back positive, it may be a sign of something worse."
69,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else

70,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime
[patient] i will

71,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Patient presents with a history of hand pain with tingling and sensory symptoms
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient describes 6 months of on and off history of numbness and tingling in the right hand which is becoming more persistent.

[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Denies bowl or bladder control issues, numbness, tingling, decreased sensations, or weakness.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 130/70 mm Hg.
Respiratory rate: 18.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Clear to auscultation, bilaterally.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Lumbar back pain at the L4-5 disc space due to a herniated disc with radiculopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his MRI revealed a herniated disc with radiculopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of a corticosteroid injection. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a corticosteroid injection into the lumbar spine today. The patient was made aware of the risks of bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood vessel damage, reaction to the medication, including skin changes, swelling, and also, the risk of elevated glucose levels if the patient were diabetic.","CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):
The patient presents with low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):
The patient began experiencing left sided low back pain two weeks ago while lifting a box of books. Initially the pain was achy and sharp, in the low back without radicular features. The pain has since began to radiate down the left leg as well. The pain is made worse with forward flexion and is relieved by changing position. He denies numbness, weakness, or tingling. He also denies bowel or bladder incontinence. He has tried ibuprofen and Tylenol without much relief. Asked about a history of spine issues and stated his dad had similar back pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY:
Patient denies a history of back pain or surgeries in the past but did mention that his father has a similar issue.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient reports being a non-smoker and having an active lifestyle as an Olympic lifter and soccer player.

FAMILY HISTORY:
His dad has a history of back pain.

VITALS REVIEWED:
The patient has a blood pressure of 130/70 with a regular respiratory rate of 18 and normal heart rate and rhythm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On the examination his heart rate and rhythm are normal he has no murmur rubs or gallops he has normal bilateral upper extremity reflexes and gross sensation the lungs are clear however the lower back muscles are tender to palpitation at the l4 l5 level with tenderness in the lumbar paraspinal muscles down the right. And on the supine straight leg test on the right, the patient’s leg raises to about 30 degrees with just minimal discomfort on back exam. Plan to get diagnostic MRI focused on the lumbar spine.

RESULTS:
Running an MRI of the lumbar spine, and the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis. The MRI represents MRI of his lower back I just looked at it to see if maybe there was some underlying reason for his pain.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Mr. Ramirez you're low back pain is consistent with a lumbar back pain at the level of l4 l5 due to herniated disk with radiculopathy, which means that one of the discs that sits the bones in your lower back is bulging and the bulge is pinching on some nerves.... so this means that you are feeling the pain that radiates down your leg. I suggest a spinal injection usually with a strong NSAID and corticosteroid just injected into you lumbar spine just via x-ray seen as fluoroscopy to localize the pain. This should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain. I know this might sound a bit but this is a typical procedure that I do daily and it's done in office and so if you're ready we can organize today's plan for you."
79,"[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee
[patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way
[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece
[patient] she is five and perfect
[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days
[patient] okay alright thanks
[doctor] alright any other questions
[patient] no that's it

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 61-year-old male who presents for shortness of breath.

Shortness of breath.
• Medical Reasoning: I reviewed the patient's chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and labs which were all normal. He does have slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally on exam. I suspect his episode of shortness of breath was due to an exacerbation of asthma.
• Medical Treatment: I would like to prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.
• Specialist Referral: I have referred him to pulmonology for an asthma workup.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This seems stable.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended the patient continue Protonix.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: This problem is also stable. Continue on Imitrex as needed.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended he continue Imitrex as needed for migraines.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner if his conditions worsen.","Subjective:
This is a 61-year-old male patient named Alan who presents with a one-day history of shortness of breath. This was associated with light-headedness that he noted after a very long bike ride that he took over the weekend, followed by minor chest discomfort, which eventually resolved. He denies any fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, or abdominal pain. No sick contacts at home. An update on review of systems reveals a mild aching in the chest with earlier wheezing and a bit of light-headedness with the mild chest discomfort. He has noted no rashes, no fevers.

Assessment/Plan:
I think that he may have had an asthma exacerbation from exercising and with the allergies, so at this point in time, I'd like to go ahead and prescribe you some albuterol inhaler.

Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours, as needed for shortness of breath or for wheezing. Pulmonary referral.

Monitoring for weight gain, increased lower extremity swelling and as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.

Reflux stable, answering yes to the appropriate PPI questions.

Imitrex unchanged as needed medication. Nortriptyline should not be used again.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding.

The patient reports that she has been feeling really tired lately. She reports that over the past couple of months, her energy has really gone down. She used to be really active, trying to be as healthy as she can be with running and climbing, at least an hour or two a day. Over the past month, her activity has slowly decreased. She reports that, due to her fatigue, she has not been able to keep up with her exercise. She reports that she had noticed a little weight loss, but she believes that was due to her doing really well with her exercises.

The patient reports that her COPD is doing well. She reports that she has not been smoking since she quit. She reports that during the changes of the season, it gets a little harder for her to breathe, but she believes that is because of her allergies.

From a congestive heart failure standpoint, she reports that she has been doing really well with her diet. She reports that she has been staying away from French fries and all the other salty foods that she likes to eat. She denies any swelling in her legs.

She reports that she has a good support system with her boyfriend and her brother.

She reports that she has not noticed any blood in her stool at this time. She denies that her stools are dark or black in color. She denies that she has had any abnormal bleeding between menses. The patient denies any other symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, or malaise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills. Endorses weight loss. Endorses fatigue.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory:   Endorses shortness of breath with seasonal changes.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena.
• Genitourinary: Denies abnormal bleeding between menses.

• Cardiovascular: Regular rate. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Tenderness to palpation to the right lower quadrant.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1c is 8.2.
Labs are within normal limits.
Anemia labs: Still pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, who presents for follow up of abnormal labs.

1. Abnormal labs.
• Medical Reasoning: Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2. Her available anemia labs were normal, but we need to wait for her pending labs for a definitive anemia diagnosis.
• Additional Testing: I would like to obtain an endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
• Specialist Referrals: We will put in a referral to gastroenterology to perform her endoscopy and colonoscopy.

2. COPD.

[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] okay . and how often are you getting it ?
[patient] um , probably about three- three times a week .

[patient] no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
[doctor] okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[patient] okay .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you .
[doctor] so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have .

Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Current tobacco smoker.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Atorvastatin tablet.
Metformin.
Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.

[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return for EMG/NCV.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:
60-year-old right-handed female new patient referred for evaluation of bilateral hand numbness and tingling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Taylor reports bilateral hand numbness and tingling that was initially noted immediately post right wrist and left wrist fractures from a motor vehicle accident in December of 2020. Since then she states that she has experienced increasing numbness and tingling that she feels extends proximally from both wrists up to the forearm on the right hand and from the ring finger and pinkie finger to the forearm on the left hand. Her wrists had been classified as being ""badly broken."" Initially, she wore a splint that she states helped but did not completely resolve the left or right-sided symptoms. She states that she feels her currently left wrist, again numb, tingly, and stiff did not have fractures today only the right.
She states her activity is limited by the issue but more so at night. When asked if there were specific activities that explaining her symptoms are worse at night she was unable to provide any. She denies any specific swelling, but there is never severe pain. She states that at times she has a throbbing pain that comes and goes in her hands but that the pain feels different currently than it did with the wrist fractures. She denies any specific relief but states that when her hands are in pain the tingling goes away beside a ""dull"" tingling pain sensation that persists. She stated her hands are weak and that she sometimes cannot do everything she wants to with them due to her symptoms. When asked about specific things that she can and cannot do because of her symptoms she was unable to provide.
She specifically denies any hand swelling and discoloration. She has no loss of sensation and has not had any specific factors that makes her symptoms worse. She denies parasthesia, the drop object, and says she has literally never indicated that she has drop against prior broken her wrist.
Over the last 24 hours, she has had a sore throat, coughing, rhinorrhea, feeling like the right wrist or swollen, but I would not describe them as severe on examination. She also states her neck, arms, shoulder blades, and back are stiff. She has muscle aches and pains and notes jaw, scalp, or any joint pain or stiffness. She denies any temporomandibular, morning stiffness. She has had no fevers.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient reports constitutional symptoms over the last three weeks. She reports fatigue and weight gain. She has increasing over last week. She also reports that over the last several weeks she has had unintentional weight gain as well. She has a limited appetite and has gained 15 pounds over the last month. She states that she eats less than she usually does and has stopped going out to eat. She states that she has not been able to over the last several weeks and states that her belly remains bloated. She states that over the last week she has had some heartburn but she denies any feeling like she has any change with her belly. She denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, or blood such as thing. She denies any rectal pain or changes, mucous, or blood in her stool. She denies any involuntary movements, arthritis. She denies any back pain or discomfort, overly part of her neck or between her shoulder blades. She also denies any specific causes for arm weakness that would happen daily. She denies any history and stories of having parasthesias or pruritus of musculoskeletal pain and past comes daily of having rashes or itching or chills. However, it is an all of the dental rashes itching or chills. I'm sorry I'm not clear about that last bit of information. This line should probably be removed for the sake of clarity and style.

[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?

[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Michelle King, date of birth 01/05/1986, MRN Q27631. New patient visit for acid reflux. Past medical history of anxiety. Patient states she has had acid reflux since she was around 12 but that it has gotten worse over the past few years. She reports that sometimes on 40 milligrams of Omeprazole twice a day only helps temporarily. I will recommend changing to Nexium twice a day. No dysphagia. She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea or rectal bleeding.
No unintentional weight loss.

VITALS REVIEWED
Pulse 76, Respirations 16, Blood pressure 120/80, Height: 5'4"", Weight: 138 lbs, BMI 24

RESULTS 
None expected.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Michelle has had a several-year history of gerd. It sounds cool like her symptoms are going pretty poorly controlled with the omeprazole 40 milligrams twice daily. She's been having heartburn. She's been having he- even though taking the medication. And it sounds like she's identified trigger foods like spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, tomato-based foods. But she hasn't cut these foods out of her diet completely yet. So she's going to try to change her diet. 

She has the diet plan. Stress is another trigger that we need to address. High stress can also cause worsening of symptoms, including an exacerbation of heartburn, even though she's taking a ppi. Additionally, she can consider trying a different ppi since the only one she tried up to this point is omeprazole. If you're OK with it, we can switch Michelle to do Nexium. I will send a prescription for Nexium, 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file.
Please insert paragraph:
Differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease, gastroparesis, esophageal stricture, malignancy, lactose intolerance, gastroparesis, and cyclical vomiting
Proton-pump inhibitor-responsive non-erosive disease is the most likely diagnosis. Greater-than-expected response to PPIs has been shown to predict response to increased PPI treatment. If ineffective in resolving symptoms, referring her for a pH-impedance study or endoscopy is an option.
MIC-OSP-SCR- Hopefully, this explanation of her work and school stress and how she doesn't always have the time to remember to take [XX].getResourceBedsideProcedureOptions will let her know how important is for her to have good adherence to this medication. Periodic follow ups as an outpatient may be appropriate for her.
INSTRUCTIONS
Dietary/lifestyle: Needs identified trigger foods, which may exacerbate GERD, even if the patient is on a PPI, and not cut out completely preventing the etiological factors.
Medications: Instructed on the importance of taking the medication daily so received
Procedure: Endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus
Discharge: No acute problems identified today
Tests: Insufficient Scores on ERP

SOCIAL HISTORY 
Michelle denies all use of tobacco. 
Vitals assessed: pulse 76, respiratory rate 16, BP was 120/80.

FAMILY HISTORY
GI: Grandma with esophageal cancer. Mom with acid reflux who was on some medication that coats the lining of her stomach.

EXAM
Had a normal physical examination, nil significant to note other than a well-healed abdominal surgical scars on her abdomen. Scars on abdomen from surgery she had when a baby, 1 month old. Mom said the intestines were twisted so she had to have surgery around the time she was one month old.

IMPRESSION
GERD with underlying functional etiology. Symptoms have been poorly controlled on once daily PPI therapy. Symptoms consistently persist despite the trial of a PPI. Her physical examination revealed only well-healed abdominal surgical scars. She's not lost any weight unintentionally, has dysphagia, denies abdominal pain, denies nausea, vomiting, denies changes in bowel movements, denies constipation, diarrhea or rectal bleeding.

Current medications: Omeprazole.

PLAN
Sedation and passed a small camera through her mouth would be subjected to an EGD. Could consider protonix. If endoscopy is normal?.INVALID_PH_IDENTIFIED.Exposure of abnormal acid reflux.(&___eager)_. Not ruling out a functional etiology and separately assessing her response. 

Overall prognosis: Still has symptoms of GERD despite maximum dose PPI therapy. Symptoms consistently persist despite a trial of a PPI. Considering normal values on the EGD, extraction is still an option to be explored. Optimum response to further PPI therapy could render repeat EGD. Finally, patient symptoms of GERD without longstanding esophageal dysmotility suggest that a functional component has not developed. Nevertheless for the EMR it is relevant to see if the patient has recurringly exhibited symptoms GERD suboptimally.

Please do not include a summary of symptoms for Michelle yet! Additional information must be gathered from the patient and their response to therapy will have to be compared on follow up visits."

[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Concerns for spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diaphoresis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury. 
The patient has been having increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diaphoresis. 
The patient was evaluated in the emergency department where she was febrile (feverish) and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000. 
There were concerns for an ongoing urinary tract infection but was treated with IV antibiotic therapy. 
The patient had elevated blood pressure, headache, and vomiting. 
In the end, the patient slowly improved.[...]
Post discharge, the patient presents today to follow up regarding these concerns.

[...]

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Acute on chronic constipation.
She believes that her hospitalization was likely more related to dysreflexia with quadriplegia that she typically has. 
Change in medications as listed above.
Will obtain fasting labs in three or four weeks and repeat CBC to make sure her white count trends down.

[...]

Covid vaccine status: high risk if infected with this virus. 
As she is somewhat homeopathic, this is her hardest decision. 
She believes she does n't really need the vaccine due to her relatively young and healthy status. 
There are no other entry disorders that would place her at risk for complications. 
That being said, she may have new symptoms, then we would consider doing those labs yet again.

I noted it may take 2 to 3 months for her to feel like she is back to herself. All questions and concerns were answered during today's visit.

Note provided for her employer stating: She is unable to return to work for another 6 weeks due to restrictions in lifting greater than 5 or 10 pounds and standing or sitting longer than half an hour. I explained it takes 3 months to return to a labor-intensive job.

INSTRUCTIONS

Resume driving when feel ready to do so.
Follow up with me in 6 weeks for a telemedicine visit.","Subjective: 
CC: 44-year-old patient who is six weeks post right medial unicompartmental arthroplasty.

97,"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .
[doctor] not because of it . okay .

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Pepcid 40 mg once daily.
Claritin as needed for allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.

Neurological
Alert.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.
CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.
CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 14-year-old female with no significant past medical history brought by her parents for increasing dyspnea for two days associated with intermittent palpitation... And she was found to have a small kidney on one side. She does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks, like soda. She complains of vague pain in her stomach that has improved but not resolved completely since she started a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs reduction. She swims three to four times a week, volleyball sporadically, and softball sporadically, but she could be more active. She asks about any activity restrictions, and we inform her that she needs to pay attention to how she feels and never exercise through claudication or exhausted feelings.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient shorts `2 packs per day since he was 25. He is employed as a sales clerk, divorced, and she lives with her mom and her brother at home. She denies any tobacco usage and illegal drug use. She does have a significant exposure due to her work as a sales clerk to cigarette smoke.
EXAM: T 37.1 °C, HR 91, BP 121/71, RR 20, oxygen saturation 99% in room air, general exam is unremarkable. HEENT exam unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Hypertension. Hematuria, and history of a neurological disorder in the newborn period consistent with posterior urethral valves. Dense amblyopia OD. Amblyopia OS.
PLAN: MRI abdomen with and without contrast, MRI brain with and without contrast. Blood pressure readings twice per week to follow with the pediatrician. We will also schedule a videourodynamics and a renal ultrasound, and we will have her back in six weeks for follow-up. Start Amlodipine tense ama, one-quarter tab bid if her blood pressures remain elevated. If diarrhea is bad or gets worse, stop the drug and let us know, Patching two hours per day for the right eye. Patching four hours per day for the left eye. I have prescribed atropine to her left eye and will check to see if it can help."

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.","CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):
- Patient presents with left lower back pain after back surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):
The patient reports left lower back pain. He had left back surgery in November of 2020. Pain radiates down the left leg. Pain is present the majority of the time. Pain was managed with ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily. Ibuprofen was discontinued when admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. Pain is described as electrical, and sharp shooting pain that radiates down the left leg from buttocks to foot. Pain seems to be relieved with stretching. Pain level is variable from 5-8/10.
Any pain with standing for long periods of time
Some pain, no radiation, 6/10
Any pain with sitting for long periods of time
Seems to be the same with standing, 6/10
Review of Systems:
Neurologic:
Peripheral motor weakness: Subjective weakness in lower leg strength
Peripheral sensory sensation change: No loss of sensation
Vascular:
Leg swelling: None
Changes in skin color or hair growth: None
Pulses: Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITALS REVIEWED:
Temperature: 98.6F orally
BMI: 22.3
Blood pressure: 120/80mmHg
Pulse: 60/min, regular
Results:
- X-ray from today NO fx detailed evaluation: AP pelvis
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Diagnosis:
Chronic left lower back pain with radicular symptoms.
466 - Myositis 
206.xx - Lumbosacral or sacrococcygeal spine - Infection
202.xx - Lumbosacral or sacrococcygeal spine - Neoplasm
521 .0x - Lumbosacral spondylosis
724 .2 - Lumbago
At this time, we do not have enough information to rule out mechanical back pain and you recommend outpatient therapy to include stretching, immobilization, and a back brace
Medication management
The patient will be discharged with prescription for Meloxicam 15mg PO QD.
If the patient decides to start taking the Meloxicam it is recommended that he also add Lisinopril 10mg G038 PO QD as it can have a lower risk of symptom control and also decrease stroke risk.
Diagnostic evaluation: Short stay AP pelvis where you ambulated fine, back x-ray shows L5-S1 surgically altered.
INSTRUCTIONS: 
No suture removal
No follow-up necessary
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
None
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
None
EXAM: 
Pertinent findings
IMPRESSION:
1. Complex regional pain syndrome of the left lower extremity
2. Neurologic symptoms consistent with left sciatica with associated muscle spasms, likely from primary back pathophysiology
PLAN:
1. Physical therapy - may be beneficial... currently delaying her return to work
2. Stop Gabapentin - as it has not significantly improved her fascinating rash
3. The dorsal horn pathophysiology is not well understood and would benefit from PT…spinal cord
4. PT evaluated in ED

[patient] sorry to put you off i do n't think i have that script
[doctor] oh
[patient] maybe a different one i wonder if patient has history of
[doctor] macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[patient] i do not no that sounds great
[doctor] okay","CHIEF COMPLAINT

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.
- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be performed in 6 months.

[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] okay
[doctor] bye
[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay
[doctor] yes sir
[patient] alright very good any questions at all
[doctor] no
[patient] okay so","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Beverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.

The patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in a Children's Hospital.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm, dry and intact
MSK: 
Examination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.
Examination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.

[patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual
[doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently

[doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently
[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic
[doctor] okay
[patient] so
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been
[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies
[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that
[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great
[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.

For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.

CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","**Note:**

The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.

109,"[doctor] so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of headache she has a history of hypertension and diabetes so donna tell me what's going on
[patient] yeah lately i've just been having quite a bit of a headache and i mean every now and then i'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and i've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried
[doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings
[patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two
[doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed
[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too
[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar
[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred
[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that
[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal
[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them
[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again
[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever
[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to
[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be
[doctor] okay
[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol
[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before
[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one
[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose
[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache
[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness
[patient] right here
[doctor] yeah
[patient] just a little not really too much
[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there
[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here
[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness
[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say
[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me

[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades
[doctor] nice
[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese
[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days
[doctor] alright
[patient] so
[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick
[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway
[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay

[patient] she is doing fine
[doctor] she
[patient] as long as she stays on the other side of the house no
[doctor] yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation
[patient] just right underneath my eyes
[doctor] on one on what side
[patient] actually both
[doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here
[patient] yep
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt
[patient] little bit yeah
[doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good
[doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound
[patient] okay that sounds like good good plan
[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound
[patient] okay i'll try that i try my best
[doctor] alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay

Cough, right knee pain 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 74-year-old male teacher that presents to the clinic with a cough x one week. Originally, he thought he was dealing with just a typical cough, but it began to worsen in the last two days with productive yellow sputum. However, the patient denies any fevers or chills.

The patient's wife has a history of diabetes and COPD and bowel problems and other viral infections such as his recurrent epistaxis and diarrhea. The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, looking to continue his blood pressure medication.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension: The patient has a known history of hypertension. The patient has a history of hypertension which requires mediation to maintain a controlled hypertension.

The effects of their medications do take an effect, however, the patient does not monitor that properly. Patient did describe more issues to surrounding peletonia, where there was little fluid management rather than medication this week not on diuretics so patient does not know why peletonia is coming up in this medical note as there is no understanding to diuretics are peletonia so this error in being compiled into this database however needs to be further researched and revised as a possible error.

The patient chooses to defugilate with current recommended blood pressure medication.

Examination:

[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Genitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.
Musculoskeletal: Reports back pain.

VITALS

Oxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.
NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Chronic lumbar back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.
","CHIEF COMPLAINT:
The patient presents today with a chief complaint of chronic back pain. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Steven has been experiencing upper and lower back pain for the past two years. He states that his pain began after he bumped into something while playing basketball and landed hard on his back. The pain is sharp and throbs but only sometimes radiates to his left leg. He states that several things make his pain worse including standing for long periods, bends forward, and bends backward. The patient is also experiencing occasional urinary and stool incontinence. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Mental Status:
GCS 15. No evidence of cognitive impairment.
Back:
There is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Bending forward does cause him pain. And he has pain with lumbar flexion and extension.
Legs:
As I Raise his left leg, this provokes his back pain.

NEUROLOGIC: 
The neurologic exam was performed to evaluate the patient’s level of consciousness, cranial nerves, motor function, gait, abnormal movements, sensory function, and reflexes. 

VITALS:
Blood Pressure: 132/79 HR: 74 RR: 16 T: 98.8F oxygen saturation 98%

RESULTS:
MRI of his Lumbar Spine: There is disk desiccation with a disk bulge and left paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate left for neural foraminal stenosis. Diminished T2 weight signal is seen within the intervertebral disk at L4 L5. Clinical correlation is recommended.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and MRI results it is likely that the patient is suffering from radiculopathy from an L4-L5 herniated disk. I believe that this patient should receive a guided Lumbar Epidural Injection with a small selection of floroscopy. Mr. Stephen does need to learn about all the risks, benefits and potential side effects but this a healthcare decision that he must make for himself. If there are any questions I can be reached in my office at extension 123.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Therapeutic injections for lumbar epidural

FOLLOW-UP:
This is based on clinical reasoning and not explicit research.  Injections may be repeated monthly up to four times a year. At the same time, the patient should attempt implementing their weight loss program.

FAMILY HISTORY:
Although the patient thinks that no one in his family has spine troubles, including any younger siblings, he should verify this with his guardian and parents as there may be genetic factors.

115,"[doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you

[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
[doctor] it was
[patient] it was just phenomenal
[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes

Vision changes in the right eye.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports right eye vision changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage
Examination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.

RESULTS

OTC:
Drusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.

Fluorescein angiography:
Reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Wet macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT** (or **CC**): Vision changes, right eye complaint.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS** (**HPI**): The 68-year-old patient presents with vision changes primarily in the right eye with worse vision lying mostly in his right eye. The patient states that he has noted increased difficulty with reading in dimly lit environments. Also reports straight lines appearing wavy, and he endorses a visual defect usually found extending from the center towards the visual periphery. In the far periphery the right eye is described as being blind. He denies any recent traumas, headaches, infection or change in medications. The patient does report a significant decrease in near vision. He also states when the shadows cross his visual field the shadows appear as sort of a curtain drawn across them. He then started noticing that when he looks at bright objects that there is a a shadow in a half moon type biconvex shape that has been progressively growing in size since around the beginning of September. The patient also reports when he moves his right eye his vision in the right eye decreases in acuity. He also mentions that his ability to see shadows or contrasts has been decreasing. He reports that his peripheral vision is not good but he has not found any difficulty in moving about. He has not found his inability to see his nose a distraction however he does report that seeing is not easy. The patient denies any flashes, floaters, loss of peripheral vision. He reports that he does have behind the nasal field deficits but these are not affecting him in any way that he has noticed. He does report that his vision outside of the central part of the visual field is distorted and sometimes stars are present when he opens his mouth. He states his vision is now darkening and he cannot see out to his right peripherally. The patient reports he cannot see the right periphery. I asked him if he is winking his right eye. This does seem to be occurring as he has decreases in central visual acuity with his right eye. The patient also reports when he tests by covering his right eye that he is now only able to see with his left eye that is if he opens both eyes, the vision in his right eye darkens considerably. He has noted the inferior part of his right visual field seems to blank out very suddenly. However his darkening vision remains unchanged. He states usually this is just central, however he does have a history of severe right oculomotor deficit. He reports he has difficulty with his right eye. He reports when this occurs he gets photopsias or he sees color spots in his vision field. He believes this occurred without provocation. 

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION** (**PE**): The eyes ; the visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart at 20 feet taking in to account both density and clarity of characters. The patient was able to count fingers at 1 foot in the superior and inferior quadrants and on the temporal side of the right eye examining the right eye, his visual acuity counting fingers in the superior and inferior quadrants and he has complete inability to see. In bright light he states it clears up a bit with a shadow or he sees a half circle in some cases. He is able to see in dark with both the evening and morning light as well. He reports again that he is just happy to be alive. He does report not being able to see his eye at night with any eye movements. He denies any blurred regions or any unusual floating spots that he is aware of except when he tries to use his device to light up the room. He reports no status at all. I completed a mini mental status exam with the patient at this time. He was able to state today he has improved in his vision. He denies any mastagensis to either eye and he denies any unusual secretion from either eye. The patient reports that he has a partial loss of his inferior visual quadrant in his left eye.

**VITALS REVIEWED** (**VR**): Vital signs reviewed and overall the patient looks very comfortable. He is comfortable seated, the bright light test seems negative and there are no problems with him especially in the right eye. Both eyes are now brown without any problem and in clear light the pain is constant all over. The eye exam is marked as normal with a small black mole in the anterior part of the left eye in the pectoralis. His right eye is unremarkable. The lacrimal apparatus is reported as being negative. The retina shows signs of RD. On the right side there is a retinal telangiectas and the fovea is reported as being dry. His right eye was noted at the time to be unremarkable. I completed a grid mapping all over the right quadrant looking for possible amplitude on bright light. The patient has small drainage of the fovea with increased rigidity in the central vision. The retina looks hazy. The macula is diffusely hazy with an absent foveal reflex. When the patient is done with this test, he will be sent to a vascular surgeon for management as the retina was noted to be of non SQ origin.

**RESULTS** (**R**): The patient has been referred to treatment with all the nerve conduction tests, he is scheduled for retinal screening with visual acuity, pigmentary deposits, a retinal neovascular membrane, and a drusen deposit all of which are in line with typical retinal occlusion.

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN** (**A/P**): This ophthalmology encounter notes concern for a central six degree scotoma in the right eye with exacerbation upon eye movement and lessening vision when viewing dark shadows with bright light examination. The patient notes that it is difficult for him to see down the left palate and can only see the shadows were clear, retinal pigment epithelium appears to be mostly dry and slightly pigmented at time of presentation.

The patient will be monitored closely and further testing will be conducted to evaluate his new dysfibrillary band atrophy in his right eye as well as his muddy appearance in the macula and perimacular regions centers. I do not have sound autonomic disease to evaluate for possible dry vs wet ARMD. 
The patient is losing a lot of amniotic fluid through his eye. I suspect it might be a shunt purpose to preservation however the eyes will be provided to lasers to the retina to prevent further vision loss. 
As discussed during this visit, the newlyweds anticipate progression of the relentless scotoma in the right eye due to hypertensive cardiovascular disease (essential hypertension and detached retina due to the neovascular membrane) and age-related macular degeneration of the retina (dry), when he will be the recipient of extra toxic transconjunctival inspirations with running of the PCS pushed into every injection for evaluation of PVD with CXL therapy. 
Plan for today is to schedule an appointment with Dr. Nevarez Ron today. This patient is well aware and compliant with treatment of his vision problems. 
Thanks for allowing me to participate in the eye care of this distinguished and respectful elder."

He can take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. If his pain does not improve with the medication, he will return to the office and we will consider formal physical therapy.

With regards to his right shoulder, I have recommended that we obtain x-rays of the right shoulder as well.

[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk

[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay

For the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports placement of a coronary artery stent in the right coronary artery in 2018.

SOCIAL HISTORY

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath.
Genitourinary: Denies changes in urination.
Musculoskeletal: Reports swelling in bilateral lower extremities and great toe pain.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 135/80 mmHg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Jugular venous distention up to approximately 9 cm. There are no carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.","CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath
