ER follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.

The patient states he was not staying on top of his blood sugar readings and felt "" woozy "" over the weekend. His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.

Regarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.

Regarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes.

[patient] i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week . so i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .

[doctor] yeah .
[patient] . i was actually in gymnastics class .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .

[doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine .
[patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .
[doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?
[patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .

[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

New acne evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today.

Kayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient’s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.

The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Lives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.

FAMILY HISTORY

No significant family medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Comedonal acne.
• Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

PLAN

Comedonal acne.
We discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter.

13,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .

ASSESSMENT

• Macromastia.

Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.

PLAN

I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.

Risks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

The patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.

[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
[patient] that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .
[patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?
[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .
[patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .
[doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .

[doctor] okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
[patient] that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
[doctor] yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .
[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .
[doctor] okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] how about there ? and your feet ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .
[patient] good .
[doctor] yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
[patient] yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
[doctor] great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .
[patient] great .
[doctor] so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .
[patient] i'll do my best .
[doctor] and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , i do . when do i need to come back and get checked out ?
[doctor] well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months .
[patient] all right , thank you . it was good to see you again dr. hughes .
[doctor] you as well ms. sanchez , do take care .

Status post mitral valve repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Melissa Sanchez is a 58-year-old female being seen today for a status post mitral valve repair, completed on 08/03/2020.

On 09/17/20 we saw Mrs. Sanchez in office, and she was doing well and thus we recommended maintaining her current medications, she is using a reminder app to stay compliant with medications.

The patient reports feeling better and overall, pretty good. She denies experiencing new symptoms. She is still having chest pain intermittently, and her breathing “gets shallow” which results in her “slowing down” and decreasing her exertion. An episode of shortness of breath and chest pains may last a few minutes and will not recur for a few weeks.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Mitral regurgitation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes Type II.
Asthma.

Surgical
Mitral valve repair 08/03/2020.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Coumadin 4 mg daily.
Lasix 40 mg daily.
Atenolol 50 mg daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Head and Neck
No JVD detected.

Respiratory
Lungs have reduced breath, but auscultation and percussion are clear.

Cardiovascular
Rhythm is irregularly irregular, S1 slightly accentuated, no S3.

Musculoskeletal
Trace peripheral edema on extremities.

RESULTS

ECG, 12/26/2020.
Impression: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response, t-wave inversion anteriorly. Compared to the previous study, there are no significant changes. I also recommended that the patient continues to be active within her limits.

[doctor] i'm great , thanks . so how have you been since the last time ? i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose , correct ?
[patient] yes . i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough .
[doctor] aw , that's great to hear .
[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .
[doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ?
[patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?
[patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .
[doctor] okay . and what happened ?
[patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?
[patient] well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did .
[doctor] okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?
[patient] no , they did n't give me one .
[doctor] okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?
[patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .
[doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .
[patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .

[patient] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .
[doctor] okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .
[patient] yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .

[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .

Heart murmur.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.

Ms. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a “new, worrisome” heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling “overly tired” but attributes this to her polypharmacy.

The patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hyperlipidemia.
Hypertension.
Hypothyroid.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Requires a walker to ambulate.

FAMILY HISTORY

Son had a myocardial infarction.
Brother had a stroke and has diabetes.
Older sister has an unknown heart problem.
Family is positive for heart disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Levothyroxine.
Lisinopril.
Simvastatin 20 mg.
Meclizine.
Amlodipine.

ALLERGIES

No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly, no acute distress.

Cardiovascular
Normal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.

Musculoskeletal
Lower extremity edema

Neurologic
Gait normal for age.

RESULTS

EKG
Impression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.

ASSESSMENT

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.
","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):**
New onset heart murmur.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):**
Patient presents with a concern for a new worrisome heart murmur after being informed by her primary care physician. She reports a month-long history of leg pain, leading to recent chest x-ray, and subsequent initiation of pain medication. Patient reports subjective exertional shortness of breath with worsening over the past six months. She reports no palpitations, chest pain. She notes recent ankle swelling that fluctuates in severity. She reports subjective limiting symptoms from both leg pain and dyspnea. She reports stable weight loss over the past year. She reports no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Reports occasional lightheadness managed with meclizine. Patient's physical exam is significant for a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
Positive for subjective fatigue, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, occasional lightheadedness, ancle edema, and leg pain.

**RESULTS:**
Blood pressure was within normal limits. EKG showed sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and an anterior septum infarct pattern.  

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**
1. Systolic murmurs with murmur workup: The plan for the patient would include an Echo to evaluate severity and etiology of the murmur. The findings of the study would be discussed with the patient during the follow-up visit.
2. Leg pain: The patient's leg pain could be multifactorial and needs further review to understand and correlate with findings from the Echo. 
3. PVCs: Given the patient's EKG findings today showing frequent PVCs, further risk stratification and management would involve a comprehensive evaluation process.

He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol.

This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management.

[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity

[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury

[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly
[doctor] do n't recall alright
[patient] something i had taken it before
[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound

[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot
[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though
[doctor] okay now does it hurt
[patient] no i ca n't feel it

[patient] they're hoka's

[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago
[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so what do you like about them

[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight
[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no it's okay
[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay

[doctor] alright do you have any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.

The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.

Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever and chills.
Skin: Reports right foot wound.
Neurological: Reports neuropathy.

VITALS

Temperature: 98.1.
Heart rate: 72.
Respiration: 16.
Blood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.
SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):**

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.

His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 180/80 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
RESPIRATORY:
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.

[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[patient] no it's right here
[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there

Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

[doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches
[patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here
[doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe
[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on
[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation
[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse
[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the
[doctor] in my on the side of my vision
[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face
[doctor] no i have n't
[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running
[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics
[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[doctor] it is
[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

Neck pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jack Torres is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago after he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He states that he was hit in the back and experienced whiplash. Following the accident he did not present to the emergency room and he does not recall having any swelling or bruising at the neck. He localizes his pain to the posterior aspect of his neck. His pain level is rated at 7 out of 10. When taking ibuprofen he states his pain improves to 5 out of 10. He finds that neck range of motion exacerbates his pain. Initially after the accident he reports that he experienced a couple of headaches, but he states he has not had any recently. He denies any hearing problems or visual disturbances.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he played football years ago without any neck issues.

RESULTS

3 views of the cervical spine were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Neck strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture or bony abnormalities. Treatment options were discussed and conservative treatment has been recommended. He will begin taking Motrin 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A prescription for Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed was also provided. He was advised to be mindful of how he moves his neck and to be conservative to avoid straining his neck. I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI for further evaluation as the patient did not go to the emergency room following his accident. He will also be referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor pending his MRI results.

[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that
[patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bobby Flores is a 56-year-old male, right-hand-dominant, male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain.

The onset of his pain began a few weeks ago, when he was performing different projects in his backyard. He states that he was sore all over the next couple of days. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right shoulder. His pain is aggravated with movement. The patient denies any restriction with his arm. He also reports pain at night when he sleeps on his right side. The patient denies any numbness in his arm or hands. He has been taking Advil and icing his shoulder, which provides some relief. The patient reports a history of right shoulder pain when he was younger while playing baseball.

The patient also has complaints of bilateral foot and ankle pain. He attributes this pain to the yard work he has been doing. For treatment, he has iced and elevated them, which provided some relief.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Positive for right shoulder pain.
Neurological: Negative for numbness in hands.

VITALS

Temperature: 97.8 degrees F.
Heart Rate: 62 BPM.
Respirations:16.
Blood pressure: 116/84 mm Hg.
Oxygen saturation: 99 percent on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: >Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Neurovascularly intact on the right. Sensation to touch is intact on the right shoulder.
MSK: Examination of the right shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness at the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip.

RESULTS

3 views of the right shoulder were taken. These reveal no fracture or dislocation. No abnormalities noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.
2. Bilateral foot pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder to evaluate for a possible rotator cuff tear. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks. He can continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend a cortisone injection.

In regards to his bilateral feet pain, I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I am recommending the patient soak his feet in an Epsom salt soak as well as elevate as needed.

[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me

[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs
[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
[patient] yeah for the most part
[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er

[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation
[patient] probably about a month ago
[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that

[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again
[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis

32,"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection
[patient] alright thank you
[doctor] alright thank you

The onset of his pain began 2 years ago, after moving furniture. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain as sharp and stabbing. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates distally into his right leg and occasionally into his great toe. Sitting will increase his pain and he notes he is unable to get comfortable. The patient also reports numbness and tingling, especially in his right leg that radiates distally to his foot. He adds that he tries to be as active as he can, however it has been difficult with his back pain. The patient adds that he has gained weight over the past year. He denies any loss of sensation in his genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control.

In the past, he has attended physical therapy. The patient has also been prescribed pain medications, however they only provided temporary relief. He would like to avoid any surgical procedure at this time.

[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions
[patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me
[doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 70 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.

Integumentary
- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.

RESULTS

CT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

[patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys

[doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all
[patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid
[doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches

Right ankle injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jerry Cook is a 45-year-old male who presents today with a right ankle injury.

The patient sustained an injury to the right ankle while playing basketball with his son. He reports he landed awkwardly and twisted his right ankle after jumping to make a layup. His pain is primarily located along the lateral aspect of the right ankle. He notes bruising and swelling. The patient is able to weight-bear while standing. He experiences pain and feelings of instability within the ankle while ambulating and is concerned for further injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works from home and plans to coach his son’s basketball team in 04/2022. He enjoys working out and reports he recently resumed engaging in a consistent gym routine.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain and instability.
Skin: Reports right ankle bruising and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill.
SKIN: No epidermolysis. Intact.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Exquisite tenderness laterally. Mild tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle. No horrible malalignment.

RESULTS

X-rays, including AP, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle, were obtained in the office and reviewed today. These demonstrate a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There is no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Right lateral malleolar fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options. Recommendation was made for an open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as the postoperative recovery period following surgery. I advised that it will be 3 months before he can resume his exercise routine. In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):**
Jerry, a 45-year-old male, presented with an ankle injury.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):**
Jerry described rolling and twisting his ankle while playing basketball with his son. He noted bruising, swelling, difficulty walking, and instability in his ankle, resulting in pain. Jerry's injury occurred while he was abruptly pushed during the game. He reported an inability to walk normally without severe pain or predisposition to further injury. Jerry also mentioned a recent return to the gym.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
Exquisite tenderness laterally and some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle, no epidermolysis skin is intact, brisk capillary refill, and no horrible malalignment. Additionally, Jerry reported immense pain when standing or attempting to walk.

**RESULTS:**
X-ray findings displayed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level without evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures. Jerry was diagnosed with a lateral malleolar fracture requiring surgery due to the fracture's position and instability when weight bearing.

37,"[patient] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
[doctor] how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided facial pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.
HENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
Bilateral finger rub test is negative.
- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.

RESULTS

MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Facial pain evaluation

[patient] well since the accident yes
[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor] okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?

[patient] no , just- just really focused on my elbows .
[doctor] okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?
[patient] uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .
[doctor] okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?

[patient] so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
[patient] yeah , go for it .
[doctor] squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts .
[doctor] okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Endorses right knee joint pain. Endorses chronic back pain.
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neurological/Psychological: Appropriate mood and affect. Grips are equal bilaterally.
• Neck: Supple without thyromegaly or cervical lymphadenopathy.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Musculoskeletal: No lower extremity edema. Pain with patellar inhibition. Pain with range of motion of the right knee.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Thompson is a 27 y.o. female who presents today for evaluation of right knee pain.

Chondromalacia of right patella.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been more active lately but is unaware of any injury to the knee. Her recent x-rays were normal but she did have some discomfort on exam.
• Medical Treatment: Prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day with food. I do want her to do some straight leg raising exercises that will strengthen her quadriceps.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to participate in physical activity that is less straining on her joints , such as swimming freestyle laps, or to stop activity all together. If her pain does not improve in a couple of weeks, she will follow up.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: This is stable and well-controlled at this time.
• Medical Treatment: She should continue swimming regularly once her knee is feeling better.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with her current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current medications.

Carpal tunnel syndrome.
• Medical Reasoning: Relatively stable status post carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen with no changes at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

50,"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Yearly follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

51,"[doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3/2/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm fine , thank you .
[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?
[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.

[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .
[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .
[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .
[patient] you too .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Amanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

Mrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.

She experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, “swooshing” in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.

ASSESSMENT

• Alcohol use disorder.
• Hypertension.

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

The patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills.

56,"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

57,"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating

[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):**

[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Adams is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain.

After his injury, he felt as though he was unable to support his upper body weight. The patient reports weakness in his legs when carrying heavy objects. He reports a sharp pain in his lower back when he turns a certain way or rolls over in his sleep. The pain will resolve with repositioning. The patient was seen at urgent care and was referred to obtain an MRI, however he did not undergo this secondary to insurance issues. He has been utilizing Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, which does not provide relief. The patient notes the ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than the Tylenol, however it does not relieve his symptoms. He denies upset stomach with the use of ibuprofen. Additionally, he attempted physical therapy at his gym without any relief. He denies any bladder or bowels issues, fevers, and chills.

[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay

[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright no problem any other questions
[patient] nope
[doctor] alright thank you for keeping me accountable","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Teresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief. The patient denies any previous elbow injuries.

The patient has a history of hypertension. She states she has been checking her blood pressures regularly. She adds that her blood pressures have been in the 110s to 130s range. She affirms she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and denies missing doses.

Regarding her diabetes type 2, she reports she sometimes forgets to take metformin 500 mg twice daily. At times, her blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. She states that she has a sweet tooth and indulges in home baked goods. For exercise, she walks in the evening and in the morning. She walks 1 to 2 miles per day around her neighborhood.

The patient enjoys working with ceramics as well as baking cakes and cinnamon rolls for family gatherings.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right elbow was reviewed today. It demonstrated no evidence of any fractures. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.

I have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.

The patient’s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.

All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT** (or **CC**): Right elbow pain

[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel

[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type

[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.

MEDICAL HISTORY

He states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee lateral collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.
","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Right knee pain following injury two and a half weeks ago.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):** The patient reports injuring the right knee stepping off a curb two and a half weeks ago. He recalls turning over his ankle at the time. Following the injury, he felt ankle soreness initially, which then resolved, and left him with knee pain. The patient states that there is no pain present when lying on his back with his legs straight.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:** The patient reports that he occasionally experiences numbness and tingling in his right foot stemming from a previous foot injury. The patient confirms experiencing positive numbness and tingling in his foot due to a previous foot injury and states that the injury was not associated with his current knee pain. The patient also notes that his knee clicks when he walks and performs a full squat.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:** On musculoskeletal exam of the right knee, slight edema and effusion are appreciated. There is tenderness upon palpation, although there is no pain when pressure is applied to the outside of the knee. A varus test is performed and demonstrates a positive test. Full range of motion is noted. On a cardiovascular exam, pedal pulses are palpable and symmetric.

**RESULTS:** Results of an x-ray of the right knee reveal no acute fracture or bony abnormality.

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:** The patient is diagnosed with a lateral collateral ligament strain based on exam findings. A spontaneous healing process is expected. The patient is prescribed Meloxicam 15 mg once daily and referred to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. The patient is also advised to continue icing the knee, and an MRI may be considered if no improvement is noted.

**INSTRUCTIONS:** The patient is instructed on knee strengthening exercises, icing protocol, and the rationale behind the medication prescription.

**MEDICATIONS:** Meloxicam 15 mg once daily

**EXAM:** Musculoskeletal exam of the right knee

**IMPRESSION:** Lateral collateral ligament strain

**PLAN:** Physical therapy for strengthening exercises, continue with ice application and monitor for improvement, consider an MRI if necessary.

66,"[doctor] hi dennis how are you today
[patient] good
[doctor] so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here
[patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf
[doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today
[patient] i i will run about ten klometers
[doctor] okay
[patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour
[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[doctor] okay
[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh
[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore
[doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later

[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics

[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound

VITALS

Within normal limits

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.
- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Bilateral lower limb edema. Pitting 1+.

RESULTS

EKG is reviewed and demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm. Good R wave progression. Evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a STEMI.

Echocardiogram is reviewed and demonstrates a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease that we will continue to monitor.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue aspirin 81 mg daily and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily. She will continue Lipitor 80 mg a day and Toprol 50 mg daily. I am going to refer her to cardiac rehab for education and to gain confidence to resume exercising regularly.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: A recent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. She was able to be treated in the cath lab in a timely manner, so I think that the muscle is just stunned. Given her history. it will improve over time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that she will recover since she is compliant with her medications.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Acute heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid.
- Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day. I want to add Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. I will order lab work. We will obtain a repeat echo in approximately 2 months.

4. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Blood pressure is well controlled. She will tolerate the Aldactone well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue exercising and to be cognizant of her diet. I explained that there are healthier alternatives available to reduce the amount of preserved meats she consumes.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient received a referral to nutrition counseling to consider what other diet options might be available to her.

5. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin as prescribed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

69,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you

70,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime

71,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

Right ankle pain and swelling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Hernandez is a pleasant 42-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain and swelling. The onset of his pain began yesterday after he slipped and fell on the ice while taking out the trash. He states that he was unable to ambulate at the time of injury and that a friend had to help him up. He then proceeded to ice and elevate his ankle throughout the night. His pain has since improved and he is able to bear more weight on his right ankle, however he is still limping. He denies experiencing any numbness to his right foot. In addition to ice and elevation he has been taking ibuprofen for his pain, which has provided some relief. He does not recall any other previous injury to his right ankle.

He is to also utilize crutches for the next 1 to 2 days followed by weight-bearing as tolerated. For pain control he can continue to take NSAIDs as needed. We discussed that he should see significant improvement in his symptoms over the next 2 weeks.

[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright any other questions we got
[patient] that's it
[doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today

Chest pain on exertion.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a medical history of diabetes type 2. She has not been formally diagnosed with hypertension, but her blood pressures have been trending high.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of heart disease.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies diaphoresis or clamminess.
Cardiovascular: Reports chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No JVD, swelling, or carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Assessment of Respiratory Effort:
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, otherwise normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Pulses are equal.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness. Soft, no guarding.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: 1+ nonpitting edema in the ankles. No calf tenderness.

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):**  Chest pain

[doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee
[patient] right
[doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel
[patient] it does
[doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me
[patient] i can but that hurts
[doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that
[patient] will i be able to run anytime soon
[doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay

The patient also reports “creaking” in her knees. She denies any swelling or redness in her knees. Her pain is aggravated by transitioning from a seated position to standing as well as ascending and descending stairs. Her pain is alleviated by rest. The patient has been icing her knees and wrapping her knees with an ACE bandage. She also takes ibuprofen or Aleve occasionally for pain. She states she tries to be as active as she can. She enjoys running outdoors. The patient adds that she would run 5 to 6 miles per day; however, she is unable to go 0.5 miles secondary to the pain. She denies any previous injuries to her knees.

She works from home.

[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside

[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right

[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days

Angela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.

RESULTS

4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Left knee pain, possible MCL strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.

Her blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure. The patient is taking her lisinopril as prescribed.

Regarding her depression, she states she is doing well. Last year she started therapy and she has been going once a week, which has helped. Her support system is great and includes her boyfriend, mom, and brother.

The patient reports that she has been feeling really tired lately. She reports that over the past couple of months, her energy has really gone down. She used to be really active, trying to be as healthy as she can be with running and climbing, at least an hour or two a day. Over the past month, her activity has slowly decreased. She reports that, due to her fatigue, she has not been able to keep up with her exercise. She reports that she had noticed a little weight loss, but she believes that was due to her doing really well with her exercises.

The patient reports that her COPD is doing well. She reports that she has not been smoking since she quit. She reports that during the changes of the season, it gets a little harder for her to breathe, but she believes that is because of her allergies.

From a congestive heart failure standpoint, she reports that she has been doing really well with her diet. She reports that she has been staying away from French fries and all the other salty foods that she likes to eat. She denies any swelling in her legs.

She reports that she has a good support system with her boyfriend and her brother.

• Additional Testing: I would like to obtain an endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
• Specialist Referrals: We will put in a referral to gastroenterology to perform her endoscopy and colonoscopy.

2. COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. She ceased tobacco use several years ago and continues to abstain from this.
• Medical Treatment: I do not think she needs any inhalers at this time. She should continue to stay away from smoking.

3. Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and continues to follow dietary modifications, particularly with limiting her sodium intake.

[doctor] okay , that's good . and then , you know , i know that you've had , uh , prior stenting in the past for your- for your heart , and your heart vessels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how are you doing from that standpoint ? have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting ?

[doctor] okay , all right . do you ever get it just sitting there at rest ?
[patient] no i do n't .
[doctor] okay , all right . okay , and- and can you describe it ?
[patient] it's like a burn .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] it it just feels like it's burning , um , nothing terribly concerning , not enough to send me to the er , but i do notice it .
[doctor] okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ?
[patient] just , um , right in the middle ...
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] okay . and how often are you getting it ?
[patient] um , probably about three- three times a week .
[doctor] okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?
[patient] no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
[doctor] okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before . your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist . um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you .
[doctor] so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have .
[doctor] so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ? i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ?

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Evelyn Morris is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presents for her annual exam.

The patient states she has been doing okay with her herniated disc in her back. She has not had any back pain or any limitations in movement. She had a steroid injection for her herniated disc several months ago, which has been doing well.

Her right carpal tunnel release was performed a couple of years ago and she is back to work. She has full range of motion and it feels really good. No numbness or tingling in her hands.

She has had prior stenting for her heart and heart vessels in the past. Over the last month, she reports chest pain approximately 3-4 times a week with ambulation. Her chest pain does resolve with rest. The pain is described as burning and is located in the middle of her chest. She denies pain at rest.

She has had a little bit of nasal congestion from allergies. The patient denies, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or lower extremity edema.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.
• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion form allergies.
• Cardiovascular: Denies dyspnea. Endorses chest pain with exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
• Integumentary: Well-healed surgical scars on her right wrist.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram shows reduced ejection fraction at 45% with a slight mitral regurgitation.

ECG prior coronary artery disease. No new changes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Evelyn Morris is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presents for her annual exam.

Status post right carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well postoperatively. She has returned to work and denies any recurrent symptoms.

Herniated disc.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been asymptomatic since receiving a steroid injection several months ago. I do not think we need to refer her for any further steroid injections or physical therapy at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: If she has any recurrent symptoms, she will let me know and we can take it from there.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports a burning chest pain with exertion approximately 3 times per week for the past month. Her recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%.
• Medical Treatment: Continue aspirin and Toprol. Initiate Crestor 20 mg once daily.
• Additional Testing: We will order a cardiac stress test and a lipid panel for further evaluation.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Current tobacco smoker.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Atorvastatin tablet.
Metformin.
Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

VITALS

Blood pressure 140/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No rasping, wheezing.

Cardiovascular
Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.

No nausea or vomiting.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.

91,"[doctor] patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[doctor] hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
[patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[doctor] so it's in both of your hands ?
[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[doctor] constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
[patient] thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up after EMG testing.","\textbf{CHIEF COMPLAINT:}
60-year-old right-handed male referred for evaluation of numbness and tingling in both hands.

\textbf{HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:}
The patient reports numbness and tingling in both hands which have worsened over the past month. He attributes this to a car accident he had last December which resulted in a contusion to his head and bilateral wrist fractures. He wears splints on both wrists, but they are still symptomatic. He has mild stiffness in his neck. He describes the numbness and tingling as from the middle and ring finger on the right side and pinky and ring finger on the left side. The symptoms are mainly sore and weak, and he experiences throbbing at times. Symptoms are more prominent at night and intermittent throughout the day. He denies any loss of sensation. Patient also reports some musculoskeletal pain and nail changes.

\textbf{REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:}
Fatigue, weight gain, excessive appetite, bloating, floaters, shortness of breath, leg swelling, always hungry, nail bed changes, dryness, itching, muscle pain. The remainder of the review of systems is negative.

\textbf{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:}
Normal except for: 
- Sensation is diminished in the third and fourth fingers on the right hand and decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left hand.
- Reflexes are 1+ symmetric, 2+ knees; toes are downgoing bilaterally.
- Tinels sign is positive at wrists and elbows bilaterally.

\textbf{ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:}
Assessment is consistent with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, potentially bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. Likely bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome given the history and examination findings. To further evaluate, order nerve conduction studies to determine the location of irritation. Depending on the test results, possible referral to hand clinic for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery or orthopedist for similar management. Splints should be continued.

\textbf{INSTRUCTIONS:}
Patient advised to continue wearing splints. Nerve conduction studies and EMG planned, followed by further management based on results. Follow-up after nerve conduction studies are done."

[patient] i am .
[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.","CHIEF COMPLAINT:

[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.
","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia who was admitted to the hospital with concerns for spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diaphoresis. She was found to have a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 and was diagnosed with UTI. The patient presents today for a follow-up regarding these concerns.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
The patient reports increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. She was evaluated in the emergency department after being found febrile with a significantly elevated white blood cell count. She was treated with IV antibiotics for a presumed urinary tract infection and slowly improved. The patient was sent home on 07/02/2021 with a follow-up. She also feels that her blood pressure was high due to constipation, which she believes was the primary cause of her symptoms.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
Review of systems was notable for irritative voiding symptoms, constipation, diaphoresis, and symptoms secondary to presumed autonomic dysreflexia.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
No acute distress, lungs CTA bilaterally, heart regular without murmur, no hepatosplenomegaly, voluntary rectal tone present but the patient unable to sense.

**VITALS REVIEWED:**
Vital signs were reviewed, including blood pressure fluctuations, which were noted during the hospitalization and subsequent clinic visit.

**RESULTS:**
Lab results included an elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 at the time of presentation, which subsequently trended down towards normal before discharge.

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**
The patient underwent an evaluation for autonomic dysreflexia which was multicellular with mixed success. She subsequently improved and was discharged with oral antibiotic therapy. Upon evaluation, her symptoms have since resolved, and she is noted to be clinically stable. The patient is due for a full metabolic panel and CBC to evaluate any residual abnormalities noted on last admission. The patient would benefit from a repeat CBC to monitor her white blood cell trends over time.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
I would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back for some updated fasting labs to ensure that her inflammation has resolved and the white cells tend downward accordingly.

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
The patient reports regular intake of Miralax and lactulose for constipation and was made aware of the risks to these treatments.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
History is significant for quadriplegia with a Suprapubic catheter and bladder management, followed by a history of successful management of that bladder dysfunction.

**EXAM:**
The physical examination was notable for no acute distress, no acute changes in the patient's cardiovascular status, and voluntary rectal tone present in the clinic. The patient's vitals were found to be mostly normal at today's visit.

**IMPRESSION:**
The patient appears well-managed at today's visit and without complaints or concern.

**PLAN:**
The patient would benefit from a full metabolic panel and CBC over the next few weeks and ideally in the next four weeks. We should check her CBC, especially her complete white cell count.

**ASSESSMENT:**
The patient reports a significant improvement in the short few days following her hospitalization.

**PAST HISTORY:**
The patient reports a similar hospitalization around this time last year for similar complaints, which did not return any specific cause of the previous patient's complaints.

**ALLERGIES:**
The patient reports no allergies to food, medication, or adhesive tapes.

**SOCIAL HISTORY:**
The patient reports working in customer care. There was no tobacco or alcohol use, and no illicit drug use was reported.

[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Pepcid 40 mg once daily.
Claritin as needed for allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.

Neurological
Alert.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.
CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.
CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**
Evalutation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC):** Back pain\

[patient] maybe a different one i wonder if patient has history of
[doctor] macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions

Blood Pressure: 127/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No gallops or rubs.

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.

[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.

For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Left shoulder pain.

[patient] yes that's fine
[doctor] okay great it's gon na record our conversation okay perfect so jerry tell me mister thompson tell me about your blood pressure readings recently i understand you're concerned about them they have been up they have been down what's going on and any other symptoms
[patient] normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks there have been periods where i felt a little lightheaded slight headache and when i checked my blood pressure the upper number has been occasionally over one eighty which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past
[doctor] okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that
[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side
[doctor] okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you
[patient] not recently
[doctor] okay and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure
[patient] sometimes a little heaviness in my chest but no no nothing sustained and i do n't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty
[doctor] okay excellent and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that
[patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher
[doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what
[patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded
[doctor] okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there
[patient] not usually no
[doctor] okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day
[patient] yes i am
[doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance
[patient] very rarely
[doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that
[patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately
[doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go
[patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time
[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still
[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me
[patient] how much beer should i drink
[doctor] probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you

[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days

[doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications
[patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was
[doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now
[patient] i mean i sit at home all day
[doctor] okay
[patient] watch tv
[doctor] okay
[patient] so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year
[doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions
[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
[patient] what type of smoking
[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
[patient] okay
[doctor] have you smoked
[patient] next maybe that i have n't
[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain.

At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Chronic lumbar back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.

115,"[doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you
[patient] i'm okay
[doctor] it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today
[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment
[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
[doctor] it was
[patient] it was just phenomenal
[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay

[patient] okay okay
[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes
[patient] okay thank you very much
[doctor] thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Vision changes in the right eye.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports right eye vision changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage
Examination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.

RESULTS

OTC:
Drusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.

Fluorescein angiography:
Reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Wet macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","\textbf{CHIEF COMPLAINT:} Vision changes affecting the right eye.\\
\textbf{HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:} Patient reports trouble adjusting to dim environments, decreased vision when reading in dark places, and straight lines appearing crooked.

[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk
[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have

[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay

[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight

Right flank pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Reyes is a pleasant 18-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right flank pain.

For the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.

VITALS

Blood pressure: Slightly elevated

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.
MSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.

RESULTS

CT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Jugular venous distention up to approximately 9 cm. There are no carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
