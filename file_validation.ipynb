He has been compliant with his current medications but admits to dietary indiscretion lately. His recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as mitral regurgitation.\\n• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram.\\n• Medical Treatment: Increase Lasix to 80 mg daily.\\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and record his daily weight and report those to me via the patient portal. He will contact me should he continue to experience any dyspnea.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on home monitoring.\\n• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.\\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to monitor and record his blood pressures at home and report these to me via the patient portal.\\n\\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.'}\n",
